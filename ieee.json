        "0": "The demand for cost-effective and ecologically sustainable components of machine tools is increasing continuously. Synchronous reluctance machines (SynRM) have become more and more attractive for variable speed drive applications in recent years due to the absence of permanent magnets. Advanced control approaches such as Linear Quadratic Integral (LQI) controllers or model predictive controllers (MPC) are well explored for permanent magnet synchronous machines (PMSM). This paper simulatively investigates these controllers for a SynRMdriven feed drive axis in machine tools. To evaluate this new drive concept, a simple model for SynRM considering the non-linear motor parameters is introduced. Advanced control approaches, i.e. a combination of Dead-Beat predictive controller and (LQI) controller is proposed for the position control task for SynRM in feed drives. The dynamic behavior of the feed drive system is modelled as a mass-spring-damper, which is taken into account when designing the optimal controllers. The aim is to achieve an optimal position\/speed control with high bandwidth and low sensitivity to disturbances, such as torque ripples and sudden load changes. The control performance is compared with classic Proportional Integral (PI) controllers in both time domain and frequency domain through simulation.",

SynREL is gaining more interest as a candidate for traction application in place of IM due to its simple and robust structure. Consequently, induction machine (IM) and synchronous reluctance machine (SynREL) are designed and compared for same electrical (1.5 kV and 170 A), thermal and mechanical specification in this paper. IM is found to have a higher torque capability than SynREL for the same torque speed characteristics. Around 67% of the torque at both rated and maximum speed of operation is achieved by SynREL in relation to the specification.

Both models utilize only interpolator outputs and position and angle feedback from each axis. Therefore, the proposed controller offers a modular structure and can be easily integrated with any type of existing interpolators and servo controllers in a plug and play manner without any additional hardware. The proposed cross-coupling controller coordinates five axes of motion simultaneously, resulting in better performance than the conventional individual axis controllers.

While drilling, ROV can clearly watch the drilling and coring works without being disturbed by the cloud of dust. Also, this system can perform high-speed drilling\/coring and the direction of the recovered core can be confirmed very easily.

Predicting its lifetime is an extremely challenging task, as it involves elements of chemistry, material science and electrical engineering. This lifetime prediction\/assessment, if performed under standard \u201cin-service\u201d operating conditions, can require months (and in some cases years) of testing. Therefore, accelerated lifetime tests, performed on suitable specimens, are conventionally run for fulfilling such task, as they reduce the total testing time. During these tests, the stress level applied to the examined system (i.e. insulation) is enhanced with respect to normal operating conditions, with the aim of reaching the end of life in a relatively short amount of time. It is thus of crucial importance selecting an appropriate specimen's typology, as the choice might strongly influence the tests' outcome. In this work, the accelerated thermal aging results for three different specimens' typologies, i.e. twisted pair, motorette and coil, are presented and apprised. The tests are carried out on a round enamelled magnet wire, to be employed for the winding of low voltage electrical machines. Among the three specimens, it is found that twisted pairs tend to largely over-estimate the thermal lifetime, with respect to both motorettes and coils.",

However, in the flux weakening region, it is usually difficult to determine the excitation current, while the extra copper loss due to field excitation may cause significant reduction in the machine performance especially efficiency. Therefore, a new control strategy for the HESFPMMs, which can operate in both flux-enhancing and flux-weakening regions, has been proposed. It utilises a novel feature of HESFPMMs in which the flux produced by the permanent magnets can be inherently shortcircuited via the iron flux-bridges. Hence, in this proposed method, the field excitation current is set to zero in order to avoid the copper loss of the field winding in the flux weakening region. Meanwhile, it utilizes the voltage difference between the command and real voltages, and does not require the machine parameters to modify the excitation current reference in flux-enhancing mode and the d-axis current reference in flux-weakening mode. In addition, in order to improve the tracking accuracy of the excitation current, the current feedback control is employed. As a result, the proposed method can provide a smooth speed transition from flux-enhancing mode to flux-weakening mode. It is verified by the experiments and can also be implemented for other hybrid-excited machines.",

Moreover, the model not only integrates continuous and discrete simulation, but also, it can be interactive (the operator learning curve can be introduced into the model), and includes stochastic considerations in operation time, maintenance, repairs, etc.",
        "79": "An often-overlooked aspect during the development process of electrical machines is the validity and accuracy of the machine material properties being used at the design stage. Designers usually consider the data provided by the material supplier, which are measured on material in an unprocessed state. However, the fact that the machining processes required to produce the finished product (e.g., the stator core) can permanently vary the material properties is very often neglected. This paper, therefore, deals with and investigates the effects that such processes can have on the overall machine performance. To do this, three sets of material data, the material suppliers' data, material data based on conventional characterization methods, and material data based on test samples that include the manufacturing processes, are used to develop three versions of the same baseline machine. The results of these three machines are then compared, and the resulting variations of the machine's performance are presented and described. The chosen baseline machine is a high-performance and relatively high speed, aerospace, electrical machine. Special attention is focused on the efficiency maps of the machine, as this aspect is highly dependent on the material properties that are the most sensitive to manufacturing processes such as the material's anhysteretic B-H curve and its specific core loss.",

First, the recent advancements in linear induction, switched reluctance and permanent magnet machines are presented. The ladder slit secondary configuration is identified as an interesting configuration for linear induction machines. In the case of switched reluctance machines, the mutually-coupled configuration has been found to equate the thrust capability of conventional permanent magnet machines. The capabilities of the so called linear primary permanent magnet, viz. switched-flux, flux-reversal, doubly-salient and vernier machines are presented afterwards. A guide of different options to enhance several characteristics of linear machines is also listed. A qualitative comparison of the capabilities of linear primary permanent magnet machines is given later, where linear vernier and switched-flux machines are identified as the most interesting configurations for long stroke applications. In order to demonstrate the validity of the presented comparison, three machines are selected from the literature, and their capabilities are compared under the same conditions to a conventional linear permanent magnet machine. It is found that the flux-reversal machines suffer from a very poor power factor, whereas the thrust capability of both vernier and switched-flux machines is confirmed. However, the overload capability of these machines is found to be substantially lower than the one from the conventional machine.

VFT consumes less reactive power than a back-to-back HVDC system, provides faster initial transient recovery, and has better natural damping capability. VFT is simply a doubly-fed induction machine (DFIM) where the machine torque controls the power flow from stator to rotor and vice versa. The main disadvantage of this VFT is the slip rings and brushes required for the rotor circuit, especially in bulk power transmission.

In contrast to already known scaling procedures for synchronous machines the FEM solutions of the induction machine are scaled in the stator-current-rotor-frequency-map and then transformed into the torque-speed-map. This gives the possibility to use a new time-scaling factor, that is necessary to keep a constant field distribution.

Subsequently, it is a challenge to predict the machining accuracy for a certain workpiece when the machine tool and numerical control program are determined. In order to resolve this shortcoming, the time-varying error prediction and compensation for the movement axis of the CNC machine tool was studied in this article, and the advantage of digital twin in predicting the changing trend for the physical entity was applied. The framework of time-varying error prediction and compensation for the CNC machine tool's movement axis was proposed based on the digital twin concept, which includes the physical entity layer, data transmission layer, function execution layer, and application service layer. The digital twin of the movement axis, containing a time-varying error model based on heat transfer theory and visual model, was created and packaged as a ready-to-use software for predicting and compensating time-varying error.

For low power machines, this is typically a non-issue since test beds are relatively inexpensive and accessible. However, as power levels increase into the upper kilowatt and megawatt range, validation of prototype machines and drives becomes costly. These costs are primarily: materials, transportation, and test site development and operation. The virtual machine (VM) concept provides a solution for de-risking these costs by utilizing the power-hardware-in-the-loop (PHIL) concept in conjunction with high-fidelity machine models and detailed load dynamics. The VM and load dynamics are simulated with a real-time digital simulator which generates appropriate control commands to a power electronics based voltage amplifier that interfaces via a cascaded LC-LC type filter to a variable speed drive (VSD). The controlled voltage amplifier, in conjunction with the LC-LC type filter, acts as a current sink to the VSD. Provided the voltage amplifier has sufficient bandwidth, the VM will closely represent the terminal characteristics of a real machine and load, with respect to the VSD.

The three-phase induction machines represent the majority of the machines used in the industry. Due to that, there is a motivation for researches to investigate how to improve induction machines efficiency or how to replace them with other types of machines having higher efficiency level. The benefits of the induction machine are line-start capability, robustness, and price. Line-start capability means that there is no need for extra power electronics. Avoiding of the power electronics in the case when only one certain load point is needed can lead to a price decrease, smaller environmental footprint, and more compact solution.

        "110": "Thermal errors have the largest contribution, as much as about 70%, to the machining inaccuracy of computer-numerical-controlled (CNC) machining centers. The error compensation method so far plays the most popular and effective way to minimize the thermal error. How to accurately and quickly build an applicable thermal error model (TEM) is the kernel work of thermal error compensation. On the basis of some comprehensive machine-learning schemes, past proposed TEMs had impressive merits for dealing with the thermal error modeling of single-function (milling or turning cutting) machine tools with only considering one set of thermal key points. These proposed modelling methodologies become worse when applied to CNC compound milling-turning machining centers in actual cutting applications. This paper proposes a two-mode integral TEM based on the Lasso and the random forest regression schemes to quickly and accurately predict the thermal deformations of such a machine. The first mode is the thermal error modeling for milling cutting conditions, and the second mode is that for turning cutting conditions. For data reduction, two different sets of temperature key points, one for milling and the other for turning, are obtained. Then, on the basis of the random forest regression scheme, we separately establish two TEMs but concurrently use them to predict the tool-center-point deformations of both milling as well as turning spindles. Further, we compare our proposed TEM with several frequently-used machine-learning-based TEMs and the results show that our proposed TEM are the best among all, no matter in the modelling experiment or in the test experiment. The proposed TEM has a maximum prediction error of 6.08  $\\mu \\text {m}$ for milling cutting and that of 1.455  $\\mu \\text {m}$  for turning cutting in the modeling experiment.

Isolation Forest and One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) machine learning algorithms were used to train and test the model on sampled virtual machine workload trace using a combination of VM resource metrics together. OCSVM recorded an average F1-score of 0.97 and 0.89 for hourly and daily time series respectively while Isolation Forest has an average of 0.93 and 0.80 for hourly and daily time series. This result shows that both algorithms work for the model however OCSVM had a higher classification success rate than Isolation Forest.",

Electroencephalogram, electrocardiogram, and electrooculography signals were recorded continuously while the operator was performing safety-critical process control operations in a simulated human-machine system. In coarse-grained analysis, the adaptive exponential smoothing (AES) technique is used to smooth the psychophysiological data and to remove strong artifacts without requiring templates. The MWL level is classified every 30 s by using bounded support vector machine (BSVM) and tenfold cross-validation techniques. Locality preservation projection (LPP) technique is utilized to derive salient psychophysiological features by means of feature reduction. By combining the AES-LPP and BSVM methods, the accuracy of the coarse-grained MWL classification was significantly improved by 11-13%.

It is found that an SPM-type machine is recommended since both PS-FRPM and MG machines operating in SPM modes have a higher phase back-EMF and hence torque than their RPM counterparts, respectively, as a result of a similar phase flux linkage but a higher electric frequency since the iron piece number is larger than the PM pole-pair number. Moreover, a smaller gear ratio machine is preferred from the perspective of a higher power factor and hence a lower inverter power rating, as the conventional MG machines with higher gear ratios suffer from larger flux-leakage, higher synchronous reactance and hence lower power factors, as well as higher iron losses, than the PS-FRPM machines. However, higher gear ratio machines feature lower cogging torques and torque ripples due to the smaller difference between the PM pole-pair number and iron piece number. Both prototypes of PS-FRPM machine operating in SPM mode and MG machine operating in RPM mode are built and tested to verify the finite element predicted results.",

Research into the BDFRM has been largely ignored in comparison to the BDFIM, despite the fact that it has the potential for greater efficiency as compared to the BDFIM, and the rotor is simpler to manufacture. This paper compares the BDFRM and its singly fed cousin, the synchronous reluctance machine. This is a natural comparison since both machines use the same reluctance rotor. The first part of the paper establishes relationships between the inductances of the two machines. This is then used to facilitate a comparison using the constraints that both machines have the same amount of active material, i.e., the same amount of copper and iron, and that the copper losses for both machines are the same. This analysis also allows an approximate comparison with the conventional squirrel-cage induction machine. The analysis is carried out using machine-independent normalizations.",

To improve the generalization ability, this article combines the machining parameters and the configuration parameters into energy efficiency models, for which machine-learning (ML) algorithms are used considering the lack of theoretical formulas. Based on the three-year data collected in a shop floor, a comparative study for two different cases is conducted with a particular focus on prediction accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency. In Case 1, only cross-sectional data are used to predict energy efficiency, ignoring the deterioration of spindle motors and cutting tools. Three traditional ML algorithms, i.e., artificial neural networks, support vector regression, and Gaussian process regression, are evaluated with the help of five error metrics. In Case 2, we construct the models in a more realistic situation that considers the dynamic aspects of spindle motor aging and tool wear. A convolutional neural network, a stacked autoencoder, a deep belief network and the aforementioned traditional ML algorithms are investigated. The comparison shows that all the models in Case 1 suffer from performance degradation, while deep learning achieves the long-term improvement in accuracy. Note to Practitioners-Energy efficiency models deliver many advantages, ranging from energy-aware machine design to process optimization. Although a large amount of works in the past focused on physics-based and experimental modeling for specific machining configurations, it can be more effective to improve the applicability of the modeling methods by involving the configuration variables into the models. Due to the uncertainties in both the machine and the operation environment, machine learning is adopted to fit the high-dimensional and high-nonlinear energy system.

This contribution undertakes both simulation and prediction of the residual life of the Relanex insulating material for electrical rotating machine windings. In case of simulation, the current condition of insulating material based on the input data is determined. In case of prediction, the insulation condition in the future time k+1 is predicted based on the input quantities in the times k, k-1, k-2, etc. Prediction means forecasting an output quantity in future based on the N values of this quantity and\/or the other quantities measured in the past. By means of the diagnostic quantities Ba (the quantity is proportional to the effective activation energy of polarization effects), Bv (the quantity is proportional to the effective activation energy of conductive effects) and Uk (the quantity is proportional to critical voltage) and by using a fuzzy method in the form of fuzzy models and predictors, we can determine breakdown voltage. This approach determines either the current condition of insulating material, taking into account electric strength, or the life prognosis of this material. To simulate and predict a magnitude of breakdown voltage, the Sugeno type fuzzy system was applied, especially for easy setting input parameters. According to the input quantity matrix (i.e., Ba, Bv, and Uk) measured at the Relanex insulating material samples, and according to a consecutive training phase, it is possible to simulate and predict the values of breakdown voltage Ups.

Instead, many approaches either focus on two-stage problems or the application of simple dispatching rules. Moreover, the majority of authors assume identical parallel machines, which reduces the complexity of machine assignment to a large extent. If a real world case is studied, solution methods are often customized and not adaptable to other settings. Most common decomposition approaches are critical path-related or only focus on possible permutations of job indices while utilizing simple machine assignment rules [1]. Lately, machine learning (ML) has been applied to different scheduling problems. A common application is the selection of best dispatching rules based on the state of systems parameters. We propose an alternative ML-based approach to makespan or flowtime minimization that is suitable for different configurations regarding the number of stages and number of unrelated machines per stage. To speed up the scheduling process, we apply ML in one step of our solution method: We train Neural Networks (NN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) with optimal machine assignments and makespan or flowtime values for fixed batch sizes and randomly generated processing time matrices. Afterwards, we use the trained NN and SVM to predict optimal makespan or flowtime values and machine assignments for all partial job sequences (batches) based on a given processing time matrix. Only sequences with close-to-optimal makespan values are evaluated further to determine a final machine assignment and overall sequence.",

High-speed machines designed with toothless toroidal winding configuration are beneficial to eliminating the cogging torque due to the absence of stator teeth, but the airgap flux density is reduced and inductance is small due to a large equivalent airgap. On the other hand, high-pole-count toroidal winding electric machines have the advantages of less total weight and volume than the low-pole-count machines. However, the high fundamental frequency required by the high-pole-count machine is challenging to meet with silicon-based power electronic drives because of the limited switching frequency. Silicon carbide-based devices have fast switching capability due to their MOSFET characteristics and can replace Silicon-IGBTs for high voltage applications, i.e. greater than 600 V. By using silicon carbide-based power electronic drives, the above two challenges of low inductance and high fundamental frequency requirement in high-pole-count toothless toroidal winding machines can be overcome. Research studies presented in this paper show that the implementation of silicon carbide-based drives reduces the current harmonic distortion of the high-pole-count toothless toroidal winding machine and makes it feasible for high-speed operation because low inductance and high current ripple issues can be mitigated.",

Performance and cost comparisons are presented. The synchronous reluctance design has 65% of the active material cost of the PM machine yet maintains 94% of the torque density. The result of these changes is a 31% saving in terms of cost per unit torque density.",
        "162": "In the standard support vector machines for classification, training sets with uneven class sizes results in classification biases towards the class with the large training size. That is to say, the larger the training sample size for one class is, the smaller its corresponding classification error rate is, while the smaller the sample size, the larger the classification error rate. The main causes lie in that the penalty of misclassification for each training sample is considered equally. Weighted support vector machines for classification are proposed in this paper where penalty of misclassification for each training sample is different. By setting the equal penalty for the training samples belonging to same class, and setting the ratio of penalties for different classes to the inverse ratio of the training class sizes, the obtained weighted support vector machines compensate for the undesirable effects caused by the uneven training class size, and the classification accuracy for the class with small training size is improved.

Production machines in the industry have unused energy flexibilities in their production processes. Those flexibilities like the differences in energy consumption between various machining processes or even between single processing steps could be used for demand-side management. This paper presents an approach on how to model and control the energy consumption of CNC (Computerized Numerical Control) machines. While in previous studies on energy flexibilities, mainly high energy-consuming auxiliary units are investigated, the focus of this publication is to use explicitly the flexibilities inside the process. The main idea is to optimize automatically the production process to a certain volatile energy price without significantly delaying the process, increasing the workload on the shop floor with additional tasks or jeopardizing (much) the workpiece quality. The proposed method uses a material removal simulation in combination with an energy model of the flexibilized machine tool, to be able to model the energy consumption of each processing step, and its dependencies to other steps. The energy costs can be reduced by scheduling the various processing steps. The precondition for the \u201clook ahead\u201d is a workpiece model, a model of the machine and a tool model which are described in this publication.

The flexibility to change the relative orientation between a tool and the workpiece in a five-axis machine tool offers many advantages over conventional 3-D machining. Because machine tools operate around the clock in industrial applications all over the world, there is a requirement not only for high-speed and high-precision operation but also for reduced energy consumption. This paper presents a novel controller design that aims to reduce energy consumption in five-axis machine tools. The proposed design is based on a contouring controller that has been proposed for use in high-precision machining in machine tool systems. The design also takes into consideration the relative orientation error between a tool and the workpiece in five-axis machining. The synchronous controller is used to reduce synchronous error between two parallel actuators, which is a cause of significant mechanical damage. The contouring control system has a degree of freedom (DOF) in the direction tangential to the desired contour curve because this directional error does not directly affect the contouring performance, and hence, this DOF is employed for consumed energy reduction in this study. The experimental results of feed drive motion (without machining) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller, which reduces energy consumption by 13.2%. In addition, after applying to the machining experiment, the effectiveness was increased to 27.9% because of largely reducing the control input variance caused by the machining task.",

The use of an encoder to solve this problem is possible but this reduces the total reliability of the drive. Encoderless methods can identify the required position by only evaluating the measured electrical quantities of the machine. Generally, additional test signals need to be injected into the machine in the low speed range to extract the desired information. However, in electrically excited medium voltage synchronous machines (EESM), most of the known encoderless solutions fail in the low speed range. In this paper, a novel approach to track the rotor position in a brushless excited EESM is introduced. As the excitation machine is mounted on the same shaft as the main synchronous machine, this approach focuses on the evaluation of the stator quantities of the excitation machines to identify the rotor position. In particular, the electrical asymmetry caused by the rotating rectifier is used to detect the rotor position without the need of injecting any additional test signals. However, like in the case of operation with an incremental encoder, the initial rotor position must be known to obtain the absolute position.",

        "207": "This paper discusses an analysis of internal short circuits (ISC) on a low pole dual-stator flux-switching permanent magnet (FSPM) synchronous machine. The 6\/4 FSPM topology utilized in this paper is particularly useful in high speed applications due to low pole count. One of the key feature of the dual-stator 6\/4 FSPM is that it overcomes the even harmonics which is an important drawback in the conventional 6\/4 FSPM topology. Unlike interior permanent magnet (IPM) machines, where both permanent magnet (PM) and saliency contribute to overall torque, FSPM machines rely only on the PM to develop torque. Hence for a given torque value, PM flux is higher in FSPM than IPM which makes ISC more detrimental in FSPM. Finite element analysis (FEA) is performed on both the dual-stator 6\/4 FSPM and a baseline IPM machine. Typically, IPM machines have considerable amount of spatial harmonics. However, because of its unique even order harmonic cancelation properties, the current waveforms obtained for the dual-stator FSPM are more sinusoidal which make it easier for online diagnostics of ISC.",

This paper studies the application of the SVM method for the online identification of the nonlinear dynamic behavior of the feed velocity in a CNC machining center. Both blackbox and greybox modeling approaches are tested for this purpose. Within the German Cluster of Excellence \u201cIntegrative Production Technology for High-Wage Countries\u201d, a modelbased predictive control (MPC) strategy with a linear state-space model is already implemented for the feed velocity of the CN C machining center. Due to nonlinearities, the model of the controlled system has to be identified and updated during the process. Therefore, the SVM method should be used to recurrently identify a model in every time-step. Additionally, the identified models should be capable of being formulated in a linear state-space model. The methodology is validated with measured data from the CNC machining center. The gained results for the blackbox and greybox approaches show only small deviations from the measured behavior of the system.",

They are not yet frequently used in larger electrical machines due to concerns about torque density. For example, for a design with slot\/ pole ratio of 1.5, the winding factor decreases to 0.866 which the penalty of smaller packaging size is translated to approximately 33.3% more copper losses as compared with a reference machine with winding factor of unity. In this paper, a new concentrated windings surface mounted permanent magnet machine for wind energy application with higher power density is proposed. The proposed machine utilizes 48 poles and 45 slots. The analysis shows while the proposed machine enjoys the privilege of shorter end windings and smaller packaging size, higher torque density is achieved through the winding factor of 0.952. This design with its novel pole and slot configuration, poses zero cogging torque and negligible torque ripple which these features make it a promising technology for wind energy applications.

It is revealed that the torque density and efficiency are slightly sacrificed, whereas torque ripple is deteriorated, proving the SynRM with square-wave drive still promising for the cost-sensitive application if torque ripple is not considered as a critical issue. To further investigate the additional pulsating torque under square-wave drive, mathematical model based on a-b-c phase inductance and d-q axis inductance are established, together with the time-stepping FE calculated currents.

Then, different traction systems are designed by Finite Element Method (FEM), in order to have accurate material consumptions and efficiency maps. The comparison study shows that the proposed hybrid MCM is competitive for energy saving. Therefore this new drive saves about 5% of energy in comparison with a single PMSM derive. The hybrid MCM energy saving is very close to the one of a PMSM-based MCM. Moreover, the hybrid MCM system reduces the PM volume (reduced by 53%) while increases the usage amount of winding copper, steel and aluminum, due to the existence of IM. Fortunately, the cost estimation proves that the hybrid MCM (not include inverters) has almost the same cost as the single PMSM.

In this type of machine, the rotor pole arc is usually optimized to realize the largest output torque with pole shaping methods used to reduce torque ripple. However, such approaches tend to be limited by constraints imposed on the pole shapes. It is a common practice to adopt similar PM and iron pole shapes, an approach that does not fully account for the different characteristics of PM and iron poles in CPPM machines, often leading to large even order harmonics in the airgap flux density. This article proposes a shaping method with a variable rotor profile and pole arc span being established by means of optimization by Genetic Algorithm. It is demonstrated that for a fixed quantity of PM material, different PM and iron pole shapes in combination with optimal PM and iron pole arc spans are essential for ensuring both maximum output torque and lower torque ripple when the due account is taken of flux leakage. It also demonstrates that since the flux density in the region under a PM pole is governed by the magnetic potential produced by magnets while it is governed by magnetic reluctance under iron pole, different PM pole and iron pole shapes are necessary to reduce the even-order harmonics in a CPPM machine and consequently to reduce torque ripple. The performances of optimized and more conventional CP machines are compared by finite-element method on 12-slot\/8-pole prototype motors.",

In order to solve these problems, PM machines with non-overlapping (NOLP) windings and redundant teeth for easy modularity are proposed in this paper. The comparative study between modular machines with these two kinds of windings is necessary and is the major focus of this paper. For the sake of clarity, two modular dual 3-phase machines with 42-slots\/32-poles (42S\/32P) and 192S\/32P combinations are chosen as examples to show the differences in terms of machine performance.

In the meantime, much lower torque ripple exists for the proposed modular machine regardless of the current value. The shorter and simpler end windings are beneficial to manufacturability. Moreover, the proposed modular machine with NOLP winding will be more fault tolerant due to smaller mutual inductances between phases and larger d-axis inductance. Finally, the proposed 42S\/32P modular machine is prototyped and the experiments validate the correctness of the analyses in this paper.

In order to address this problem, we propose a successive interference cancellation based non-orthogonal random access (SIC-NORA) mechanism. In the proposed mechanism, each M2M device is allowed to repeat its transmission in a finite number of time slots within a radio frame. The messages of two devices that collide in the same slot can be decoded if the difference in the arrival time of their messages is greater than the predetermined threshold. Upon the successful RACH from an M2M device, the BS applies SIC in the current and all previous slots of the radio frame to decode messages of other devices for enhanced RACH success. A Markov chain model of the proposed mechanism is developed and the corresponding steady-state probabilities are derived. Through extensive numerical results, we show that the proposed mechanism performs better than state-of-the-art RACH mechanisms in terms of number of RACH successes and average access delay. Further, the proposed mechanism improves the success rate by 65.3% and 30.3% as compared to NORA and SIC-based RACH mechanism, respectively.

Electrical machines for electric vehicles are usually operated in a wide speed range including flux weakening. In contrast to permanent magnet synchronous machines and induction machines synchronous reluctance machines have advantages of a very simple and cost effective rotor design, which makes this machine type very interesting for this application. For synchronous reluctance machines different rotor topologies as salient poles or flux barrier designs are known and both are investigated in this work regarding high speed operation in flux weakening range. Because of the mechanical strength limitation of flux barrier machines a salient pole machine is proposed, although design steps to accomplish the same machine harmonics characteristic of the salient pole type have to be implemented. Finally, both machines provide sufficient operation in the whole speed range. However, the machines show slightly different behavior and require different manufacturing technologies for the stator winding and the rotor.",

NdFeB permanent magnet(PM), which has high remanent flux density as well as high coercive force, and AlNiCo PM, which has high remanent flux density but low high coercive force, are used in this structure. The magnetization intensity and direction of AlNiCo PM can be controlled by stator d-axis current pulse. Consequently, the flux generated by NdFeB is either repelled to stator so that the air-gap PM-flux can be intensified, or partially bypassed by AlNiCo in the rotor so that the air-gap PM-flux can be weakened, and the air-gap PM-flux is kept at a desired value because of the memory capability of PM. Principles of the motors are interpreted. Finite element analysis on magnetic field is done. The size of PMs and the principles of magnetic circuit design are demonstrated, and the conclusion is drawn that effect of flux-weakening is better when the q-axis magnetic resistance is large and the inductance is small.",

An analytical model, extended to a generic harmonic order, is used to describe and determine the no load flux density, the back electromotive force (BEMF) and the electromagnetic torque produced. These are analysed as a function of the permanent magnet span. Based on the BEMF, the harmonics injection technique is adopted to increase the torque in the machine, while keeping the RMS current constant, thus without affecting the Joule losses. In order to understand how the torque is affected by the harmonics injection, considering different PMs rotor span, a comparison with and without injection is presented. It is shown how, thanks to specific harmonics injection, it is possible to reduce the permanent magnet content in SPM machines while generating the same torque performance of a motor with higher PM content, without harmonic injection.

        "371": "Objective: This study focused on developing a fast and accurate automatic ischemic heart disease detection\/localization methodology. Methods: T wave was segmented from averaged Magnetocardiography (MCG) recordings and 164 features were subsequently extracted. These features were categorized into three groups: time domain features, frequency domain features, and information theory features. Next, we compared different machine learning classifiers including: k-nearest neighbor, decision tree, support vector machine (SVM), and XGBoost. To identify ischemia heart disease (IHD) case, we selected three classifiers with best performance and applied model ensemble to average results. All 164 features were used in this stage. To localize ischemia, we classified IHD group according to stenosis locations, including left anterior descending (LAD), left circumflex artery (LCX), and right coronary artery (RCA). For this task, we used XGBoost classifier and 18 time domain features. Results: For IHD detection, the SVM-XGBoost model achieved best results with accuracy = 94.03%, precision = 86.56%, recall = 97.78%, F-score = 92.79%, AUC = 0.98, and average precision = 0.98. For ischemia localization, XGBoost model achieved accuracy = 0.74, 0.68, and 0.65, for LAD, LCX, and RCA, respectively. Conclusion: we have developed an automatic IHD detection and localization system. We find that 1. T wave repolarization synchronicity is an important factor to distinguish IHD from normal subjects 2.

In the DSPM machine, the stator\/rotor-pole number combination is 18\/13 rather than the conventional one (i.e. 18\/12)to achieve balanced three phase, sinusoidal phase flux linkage and back electromotive force (back-EMF), small cogging torque, and low torque ripple. On the other hand, an 18\/17-pole BFPM machine having the similar structure with the 18\/13-pole DSPM machine is analyzed, which has the best torque performance among such machines with the same stator pole number.

This paper focuses on identifying whether machining is performed as well as the chatter conditions generated during re-machining processes. Identifying whether or not machining conditions are met allows users to ensure the normal operation of machining equipment and identify situations that do not match the current conditional, so that they can take early action and further save on operational costs for machining. The objective of this paper is to identify the milling machining conditions, and the identified conditions will be categorized into whether cutting is required as well as whether chatter is observed. In order to identify these three conditions, sound and vibration signals are captured by sensors inside the milling machine, and the process of identification is subsequently analyzed and conditions established.

        "374": "In industrial applications, when high dynamic performance is required, the induction machine is operated under field oriented control. This implies the knowledge of the machine main flux position at any time instant. In practical operation, the flux is calculated with mathematical models considering only the fundamental wave behavior of the machine. To maintain a stable operation of such a scheme even at zero electrical frequency, the rotor position has to be known, measured by a mechanical rotor shaft sensor. Many sensorless control methods have been suggested to omit this sensor since it decreases the drives reliability and increases the costs. Sensorless schemes using fundamental wave models are based on a voltage integration. They show a good performance at high speed but fail at low and zero electrical frequency due to the low signal to noise ratio and parameter uncertainties. Other methods are evaluating parasitic effects in the machine response to a transient or high frequency excitation. This allows a calculation of the flux- or rotor position independent from the fundamental frequency. The approach given in this paper attempts to combine both methods to provide an excellent performance of the sensorless control scheme in the whole frequency range. Therefore, the fundamental wave model is stabilized at low frequencies by a method using a transient excitation method",

        "377": "The design of equaliser windings for large lap wound DC machines is generally of an empirical nature. This paper presents an analytical technique, using finite element analysis, for the calculation of equaliser currents in lap windings. Each path in a simplex lap winding is influenced by a different pair of poles. It is practically impossible to make the fluxes of all poles identical in large DC machines. The result of uneven pole strength is that the voltages induced in the parallel paths are unequal. Since the paths are in parallel, circulating currents flow in the winding; when the machine is loaded the tendency will be to overload certain of the brushes. To mitigate this effect, permanent equaliser connections are usually made to the back of the winding to join points whose EMF should at every instant be the same. The circulating currents then superimpose a partially correcting magnetic field. Since equaliser currents cannot be easily measured during operation, this investigation was undertaken to see how finite element analysis could be used to determine the equaliser current sensitivity to changes in the structure. The analytical technique was used to determine the equaliser currents in a large lap wound DC generator. The machine modelled had been rebuilt after a major breakdown when problems occurred with its equaliser windings burning out.",
        "378": "This paper presents a comparison of the small-signal stability properties for virtual synchronous machines (VSMs) with dynamic and quasi-stationary representation of the internal synchronous machine (SM) model. It is shown that the dynamic electrical equations may introduce poorly damped oscillations when realistic stator impedance values for high-power SMs are used. The quasi-stationary implementation is less sensitive to the impedance of the virtual machine model, but depends on filtering of the measured d- and q-axes components of the ac-side voltage to avoid instability or poorly damped oscillations. It is demonstrated how both implementations can be made stable and robust for a wide range of grid impedances. However, the dynamic electrical model depends on a high virtual resistance for effectively damping internal oscillations associated with dc components in the ac currents during transients. Thus, when using SM parameters with low virtual stator resistance for decoupling the active and reactive power control, the quasi-stationary VSM implementation is preferable.",

However, it is almost impossible To achieve efficient production and safety on multi-axis, multi-task machines tools without the help of on-line software systems, which is also known as the Human-machine interface (HMI).

However, the conventional method to identify diabetes is to make a blood glucose test by doctors and the medical resource is limited. Therefore, most patients cannot get the diagnosis immediately. Since the early symptoms of diabetes are not obvious and the relationship between symptoms and diabetes is complex, the self-diagnosis results based on patients' own experience are not accurate. The process of Machine Learning is to train a computational algorithm for prediction based on a big dataset. It is popular for its efficiency and accuracy. Also, it has the advantage of dealing with tons of data, so we can make diagnoses for plenty of patients in a short time and the result will be more accurate. In this study, we used six classical machine learning models, including logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree, random forest, boosting and neural network, to make a prediction model for diabetes diagnosis. Our data was from UCI Machine Learning Repository, which was collected by direct questionnaires from the patients of the Sylhet Diabetes Hospital in Sylhet, Bangladesh and approved by a doctor.

Specifically, we consider the scenario where three M2M communication devices that are close by and want to exchange their messages via a low cost relay or another device in proximity. The main advantage of the proposed scheme is twofold: 1) use of joint channel and physical-layer network coding where M2M communication devices simultaneously transmit their messages and 2) no decoding at the relay where relaying can be as simple as amplify and forward or denoise and forward. Simulation results using practical Raptor codes show that the proposed scheme achieves a near-optimal sum rate performance. Furthermore, we propose an efficiently scalable technique for disseminating information among a large number of M2M communication devices.",
        "383": "Turn to turn insulation breakdowns are often identified as a primary cause of stator-related failures in rotating electrical machines. However, it is not the interturn short circuit in itself which causes the machine outage, but rather the localised increment in temperature in proximity of the affected turns. If the fault is not promptly detected, the latter can quickly trigger a chain reaction, which eventually degenerates in the puncturing of the interphase or the ground-wall insulation systems. If a machine is designed with features for fault-tolerance, then, a physical and galvanic separation is guaranteed among different phases. Thus, a temperature increment caused by an interturn breakdown is most likely to affect the phase to ground insulation.

A smaller conductor cross-sectional area is the reason for higher ohmic winding resistance and copper losses. Therefore the copper losses are minimal at a certain number of strands.

This paper reviews the history of superconducting rotating machine development worldwide utilizing superconducting field windings both Low Temperature Superconductor (LTS) and HTS. Replacement of conventional copper field winding with a superconducting field winding yields rotating machines with superior performance, higher reliability and easier operation. Such synchronous machines with superconducting field windings have been in development since mid-sixties. Initially the field windings employed low temperature superconductors, which did not yield economically attractive devices due to small thermal margin of the field winding and complex rotor cooling system. The HTS provide much larger thermal margin and enable much simpler rotor cooling systems. This has provided a new impetus to development of such machines for Naval and commercial applications. HTS machines in rating from a few kilowatts to several megawatts have been demonstrated in US and Europe. Currently, large high-torque ship propulsion motor and large generator prototypes are under development and are expected to be commercially available in the next few years. Improved life, smaller size, less weight, and higher efficiency benefits are providing incentive for development of large HTS machines.",

Due to the use of flux memorable low coercive force (LCF) magnets, the air-gap flux of VFMM can be flexibly varied via a magnetizing current pulse. Thus, the copper loss associated with the flux weakening current and high-speed iron loss can be significantly reduced, and hence high efficiency can be achieved over a wide speed and torque\/power operation. These merits make VFMM potentially attractive for electric vehicle (EV) applications.

        "407": "A key challenge for enabling machine-to-machine (M2M) communications in long-term evolution (LTE) networks is the intolerably low access efficiency in the presence of massive access requests. To address this issue, a new analytical framework is proposed in this paper to optimize the random access performance of the M2M communications in LTE networks. Specifically, a novel double-queue model is established, which can both incorporate the queueing behavior of each machine-type device (MTD) and be scalable in the massive access scenarios. To evaluate the access efficiency, the network throughput is further characterized, and optimized by properly choosing the backoff parameters including the access class barring (ACB) factor and the uniform backoff (UB) window size. The analysis reveals that the maximum network throughput is solely determined by the number of preambles, and can be achieved by either tuning the ACB factor or the UB window size based on statistical information such as the traffic input rate of each MTD. Simulation results corroborate that with the optimal tuning of backoff parameters, the network throughput can remain at the highest level regardless of how many MTDs in the network, and is robust against feedback errors of the traffic input rate and burstiness of data arrivals.",
        "408": "The machine-to-machine (M2M) communications, which achieve the implementation of Internet of Things (IoT), can be carried over wireless cellular networks. The massive random access (RA) in M2M communications will cause radio access network congestion in the base station (BS), leading to sharp deterioration in access delay and access probability. Access class barring (ACB) that can directly control the flow of machine-type communication (MTC) devices by an ACB factor is an efficient scheme to prevent the BS from traffic overload. In wireless cellular networks, the RA resources (i.e., preambles) are shared by M2M and human-to-human (H2H) devices, and research on ACB scheme ordinarily assumes that a restricted number of preambles are assigned to M2M traffic. However, when suffering from massive access in M2M communications, it is desirable to rapidly satisfy the access requests from MTC devices using all available preambles, especially in time-sensitive IoT scenarios. In this paper, we study the massive access problem in M2M traffic centered scenarios where M2M and H2H traffic can apply for all available preambles without distinction. Utilizing the self-adaptive learning property of learning automata, we further propose a novel learning automata-based ACB (LA-ACB) scheme. Simulation results show that the LA-ACB scheme achieves the performance close to theoretical optimality. The BS equipped with the LA-ACB scheme can effectively control the M2M traffic by dynamically adjusting the ACB factor under the interference of H2H traffic and provide quality services for both M2M and H2H traffic.",

Different from traditional communication networks, the data connections with M2M communications are typically small-sized but with high frequency, necessitating the efficiency optimization of both energy consumption and computation. In this paper, we introduce mobile edge computing (MEC) into virtualized cellular networks with M2M communications, to decrease the energy consumption and optimize the computing resource allocation as well as improve computing capability. Moreover, based on different functions and quality of service (QoS) requirements, the physical network can be virtualized into several virtual networks, and then each MTCD selects the corresponding virtual network to access through the embedded-SIM (eSIM) technology. Meanwhile, the random access process of MTCDs is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) to minimize the system cost, which consists of both the energy consumption and execution time of computing tasks. Furthermore, to facilitate the network architecture integration, software-defined networking (SDN) is introduced to deal with the diverse protocols and standards in the networks. Extensive simulation results with different system parameters reveal that the proposed scheme could significantly improve the system performance compared to the existing schemes.",
        "410": "Machine-type communications are emerging as a new paradigm for enabling a broad range of applications from the massive deployment of sensor devices to mission-critical services. To support massive machine-to-machine (M2M) communications with delay constraints in cellular networks, we design an efficient random access and data transmission system known as distributed queueing random access-multiple-input multiple-output (DQRA-MIMO) data transmission system. This system has the advantages of both efficient collision resolution of DQRA protocol and the efficient data transmission of MIMO technology. To obtain higher throughput under delay constraint and limited time-frequency resources, we match the ability of collision resolution with the capability of MIMO transmission by optimally configuring system parameters. The closed-form expression of throughput is derived, which is a function of the total user equipments' traffic arrival rate, average packet number of each arrival, number of base station antennas, and number of access request (AR) slots. An optimization problem is formulated to maximize the throughput to obtain the optimal number of AR slots given a certain delay constraint for M2M traffic. Numerical and simulation results reveal that, for a given requirement of average delay, the proposed optimized DQRA-MIMO system, which dynamically adjusts time-frequency resource division to maximize throughput, can provide a higher throughput than that of a baseline approach.",
        "411": "In order to address the signalling overhead and resource allocation problems of Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), we propose a hybrid non-orthogonal random access and data transmission (NORA-DT) scheme. A novel design of NORA-DT protocol for M2M communications in cellular networks is firstly proposed. A power back-off scheme is introduced to adjust machine-type communications device (MTCD)'s target arrived power, and a closed-form analytic formula for the relation of MTCD's transmission power is derived. Based on the transmission power relation, the devices are clustered into a set of NOMA clusters. In the hybrid NORA-DT protocol, the cluster center MTCD transmits a extended preamble on behalf of the MTCDs in the same NOMA cluster on the physical random access channel (PRACH) for connection request. Base station (BS) can perfectly detect the preamble collisions in advance and schedules physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH) only to the NOMA clusters without collision. Then the MTCDs in the same NOMA clusters transmit data packets right after preamble transmission on the PUSCH to reduce the signalling overhead. By finding the optimal power allocation, we propose a low-complexity energy efficiency maximization problem for NORA-DT scheme. Due to the relation of MTCD's transmission power, we transform the problem into the function of cluster center MTCD's transmission power and solve it by difference of convex (DC) programming under the maximum transmission power constraints and minimum rate requirements at the MTCDs. A computationally efficient adaptive resource allocation scheme is finally proposed to improve the system throughput and resource usage. The optimal resource allocation between PRACH and PUSCH for any number of MTCDs can be learned by BS in advance, which avoids frequent computation. The analytic model is validated by simulation results. We demonstrate that the proposed NORA-DT scheme can significantly improve the system throughput, resource efficiency and energy efficiency performance.",
        "412": "This is a sequel of our previous work [20] on access throughput optimization of Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications in Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks. By incorporating a finite data transmission rate, this paper aims to characterize the effect of data transmission on the optimal access performance of Machine-Type Devices (MTDs). Specifically, both the maximum access throughput and the corresponding optimal Access Class Barring (ACB) factor are obtained as explicit functions of the data transmission rate, which show that even with the ACB factor optimally tuned, the access throughput may deteriorate as the number of MTDs increases, and even drop to zero if the data transmission rate is too small. To boost the data transmission rate, more resources should be allocated to data transmission, which, however, leads to fewer chances for access. In light of the tradeoff between the data transmission rate and the access frequency, the time slot length is further optimized for maximizing the normalized maximum access throughput. Simulation results corroborate that by properly choosing the time slot length, substantial gains can be achieved over the default setting in various scenarios.",
        "413": "Group paging is a baseline solution proposed by the long-term evolution (LTE) standardization body for supporting machine-to-machine (M2M) communications in the current-generation and the next-generation cellular networks. Yet, in conventional group paging scheme, upon the reception of paging message, all machine-type devices (MTDs) in a group will simultaneously access the base station, leading to severe network congestion and intolerably low access efficiency. To handle this issue, in this article, we propose a dynamic group paging mechanism, where only the MTDs with packets to send will join the contention process, and the collisions in the random access channel are addressed by the contention resolution scheme. Explicit expressions of key performance measures including the mean access delay of each MTD are derived as functions of the length of waiting period (interval between two consecutive paging periods) TW, where a smaller TW indicates a higher frequency of group paging. It is shown that TW is a key system parameter that determines the crucial tradeoff between the signaling overheads of the system during the paging period and the access delay performance of each MTD. To study how to properly tune the waiting period length, a utility-based analytical framework is established by taking the aforementioned tradeoff into consideration. The optimal waiting period length for maximizing the network utility is derived and verified by simulation results. The analysis in this article reveals that the network should increase the group paging frequency as the traffic becomes heavier or the number of preambles decreases. Providing more preambles can indeed improve the delay performance, while the gain becomes marginal if the number of preambles is large.",

In this system, underlay CR is used to manage spectrum sharing among machine type communication devices (MTCDs) and cellular user equipment (CUE) where the CUE are considered to be primary users (PUs) and the MTCDs are secondary users (SUs). Moreover, due to the limited battery capacity of MTCDs and diverse quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of both MTCDs and CUE, energy efficiency (EE) is critical to prolonging network lifetime. This paper investigates the power allocation problem for energy-efficient CM2M communications underlaying cellular networks. Underlay CR is employed to manage the coexistence of MTCDs and CUE and exploit spatial spectrum opportunities to improve spectrum utilization. Two power allocation problems are proposed where the first targets MTCD power consumption minimization while the second considers MTCD EE maximization subject to MTCD transmit power constraints, MTCD minimum data rate requirements, and CUE interference limits. The proposed power consumption minimization problem is transformed into a geometric programming (GP) problem and solved iteratively. The proposed EE maximization problem is a nonconvex fractional programming problem. Hence, a parametric transformation is used to convert it into an equivalent convex form and this is solved using an iterative approach.

        "431": "Sensorless field oriented control schemes of induction machines have been of high interest in recent years since the mechanical sensor considerably increases the cost of a drive and decreases its reliability. Methods which do not fail at zero fundamental frequency have to rely on non-fundamental effects of the motor. In the non fundamental wave model based mechanical sensorless control of AC machines the flux\/rotor position can be estimated by evaluating the current response to voltage pulses. This current slope is modulated by all spatial saliencies in the machine. Sources of these saliencies can be various, for instance the saturation of the machine by the main flux, the slotting, or anisotropy, as well as inter-modulation effects. In this paper the separation of the saturation signal, the slotting signal, and the inter-modulation signal components in squirrel cage induction machines operating at low and zero frequency using artificial neural networks (ANN) has been experimentally implemented and measurement results are given to show the advantages of the application of the proposed technique at low and zero speed sensorless control even at high load levels.",

        "434": "The brushless doubly-fed machine (BDFM) has been under investigation in its modern forms for 50 years. The reason for this interest is the machine's ability to operate as a brushless variable speed motor or generator through the use of a partially-rated power electronic converter connected to its second stator winding. Interest has increased in the last 20 years because of greater penetration of wind turbines with Doubly-Fed induction Generators (DFIGs) where brush gear and slip-ring maintenance and reliability have been a major issue. The BDFM appears in two forms, the brushless doubly fed induction machine (BDFIM), with two stator windings and a third closed rotor winding or the brushless doubly fed reluctance machine (BDFRM), with two stator windings and a reluctance rotor with no winding. This paper sets out to provide a rotor-centric view of BDFM operation, which shows the basis of its rotating flux pattern, aligning it with the known Natural Speed, and clarifying the synchronous and induction modes of operation of the BDFIM and the synchronous BDFRM. Based on rotor-centric view of the BDFM, it is shown that the conventional design methods for the BDFM stator back iron can be modified, leading to a lighter and smaller machine.

        "441": "A total of three types of doubly salient synchronous reluctance machines have been comparatively studied to improve the torque performance using current harmonic injection methods. These machines are derived from the switched reluctance machines (SRMs) with different winding configurations, such as the double\/single-layer mutually coupled SRMs (MCSRMs) and fully pitched SRMs (FPSRMs), by supplying them with sinewave current. Such current supply mode can lead to higher torque\/power density and lower vibrations and acoustic noise compared with the conventional rectangular current supply. The proposed torque analytical model can predict the instantaneous torque of the doubly salient SRMs with sinewave current excitation and the current harmonics also can be selected in order to reduce the torque ripple and\/or increase the average torque. It has been found that the third current harmonic injection shows the best performance for single-layer MCSRMs and FPSRMs because it improves the average torque and reduces the torque ripple at the same time. However, it has little influence on doubly-layer MCSRMs. To improve the torque performance of such machines, other harmonic currents, e.g., fifth and seventh, need to be used. Both static and dynamic tests have been carried out to validate the predictions.",

It is shown that by keeping the torque angle constant or regulating it in an appropriate manner, dynamic performance similar to those of traditional fixed-flux-level vector control methods can be achieved with lower energy consumption and simpler operation.

In many literatures analogous to the non-salient pole machines often it is assumed that also for salient pole machines the phase inductance is a function of rotor position, since the self inductance of this type of machines depends on the rotor position. The aim of this paper was to investigate further the performances of this parameter. Deriving a correct formula for the total phase inductance for this type of electric machines shows that this parameter is constant with rotor position, and doesn't vary as is assumed in many literatures.

In this paper, a comprehensive design procedure for high-speed synchronous reluctance machines is presented. In order to validate the procedure, a 5-kW 80 000-r\/min machine is considered. The proposed strategy consists of a two-step procedure in which the electromagnetic and structural designs have been properly decoupled, dividing the design space in two subsets. Each subset mainly affects the electromagnetic or the structural performances. Several structural design optimizations have been then performed with the aim of finding the optimal tradeoff between the rotor geometrical complexity (that defines the required computational resources) and the electromagnetic performance.

Effects of the parallel stator windings on these eccentricity force components are investigated. The results of this study showed that the parallel stator windings effectively attenuate the net eccentricity force by suppressing significantly the eccentricity harmonics arising from the modulation of the fundamental magnetomotive force by the permeance wave due to rotor eccentricity. Slotting harmonics, also considerably contributing to the net eccentricity force, are mitigated evenly in the whole whirling frequency range studied, although not to such a great degree as the eccentricity harmonics. It was shown that the reduction of slotting and eccentricity fields accounts for the major part of the unbalanced magnetic pull mitigation by the parallel stator windings.",

        "461": "Concerns the extension to the general rotating electric machine model of the passivity-based controller method for induction motors. The motor's passivity properties are used at 2 levels. First, we prove that the motor model can be decomposed as the feedback interconnection of two passive subsystems (essentially, the electrical and mechanical dynamics). Then, we design a torque-tracking controller that preserves passivity for the electrical subsystem and leaves the mechanical part as a passive disturbance. This leads to the cascaded controller structure which is typically analyzed involving time-scale separation. Our aim is to characterize a class of machines for which such a passivity-based controller solves the output feedback torque-tracking problem. The class consists of machines whose nonactuated dynamics are damped and whose dynamics can be decoupled. This requires that the air-gap magnetomotive force must be suitably approximated by the first harmonic in its Fourier expansion. These conditions have a clear physical interpretation in terms of the couplings between its dynamics and are satisfied by many machines. The passivity-based controller presented reduces to the well-known indirect vector controller for current-fed induction machines. Our developments constitute an extension to voltage-fed machines of this de facto standard in industrial applications.",

However conventional PM-FSMs utilizes excessive rare earth PM volume VPM, higher cogging torque Tcog, high torque ripples (Trip) and comparatively lower (Tden) and Pden due to flux leakage. To overcome the aforesaid demerits, a new high (Tden) Segmented PM Consequent Pole (CP) FSM (SPMCPFSM) with flux bridge and barrier is proposed which successfully reduces VPM by 46.52% and PM cost by 46.48%.

A major drawback of the conventional DTC is an unpredictable inverter switching frequency which varies due to operating speed, load condition and parameters of the induction machine. Therefore the amplitude of the hysteresis band should be large enough to avoid excessive inverter switching at any operating region, which inevitably causes relatively large torque ripple especially in the low speed region.

In high current density electrical machines, particularly those making use of liquid cooled housing jackets for heat removal, the stator to housing thermal contact resistance is on the main heat removal path of the electrical machine. So far it has always been assumed that this parameter is dependent on the shrink fit manufacturing procedure of the machine. However this paper provides experimental evidence showing that the thermal contact resistance not only varies with shrink fit pressure but is also affected by heat flux and temperature. Hence the common notion that the thermal contact resistance is a constant value set during the machine assembly, and that during thermal design this value can be applied across the whole operating range of the machine is an over simplification.

Eight FT-PM machines with different S\/P combinations are analyzed. Both the performance of the machine during normal operation and induced currents during a turn-turn SC fault are investigated. To evaluate the thermal impact of each S\/P combination under an inter-turn fault condition, a thermal analysis is performed using finite element computation. It is shown that low-rotor-pole-number machines have a better fault tolerance capability, while high-rotor-pole-number machines are lighter and provide higher efficiency.

Yet the promise of greater efficiency that such cyber-physical systems (CPS) bring is tempered by increased fragility unless machine-to-machine (M2M) trust is enhanced, particularly in Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks. This work makes two contributions toward improving M2M trust. First, it proposes a multifaceted trust framework comprised of identity verification, experience, context, and recommendation scores to enable high-integrity M2M interactions. Second, this trust framework is implemented via an IoT-friendly distributed ledger on a physical testbed, where it is shown to identify and mitigate errors due to a compromised system component.

        "573": "When training a machine learning algorithm for a supervised-learning task in some clinical applications, uncertainty in the correct labels of some patients may adversely affect the performance of the algorithm. For example, even clinical experts may have less confidence when assigning a medical diagnosis to some patients because of ambiguity in the patient's case or imperfect reliability of the diagnostic criteria. As a result, some cases used in algorithm training may be mislabeled, adversely affecting the algorithm's performance. However, experts may also be able to quantify their diagnostic uncertainty in these cases. We present a robust method implemented with support vector machines (SVM) to account for such clinical diagnostic uncertainty when training an algorithm to detect patients who develop the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is a syndrome of the critically ill that is diagnosed using clinical criteria known to be imperfect. We represent uncertainty in the diagnosis of ARDS as a graded weight of confidence associated with each training label. We also performed a novel time-series sampling method to address the problem of intercorrelation among the longitudinal clinical data from each patient used in model training to limit overfitting. Preliminary results show that we can achieve meaningful improvement in the performance of algorithm to detect patients with ARDS on a hold-out sample, when we compare our method that accounts for the uncertainty of training labels with a conventional SVM algorithm.",
        "574": "The function of a protein is determined by its structure, which creates a need for efficient methods of protein structure determination to advance scientific and medical research. Because current experimental structure determination methods carry a high price tag, computational predictions are highly desirable. Given a protein sequence, computational methods produce numerous 3D structures known as decoys. Selection of the best quality decoys is both challenging and essential as the end users can handle only a few ones. Therefore, scoring functions are central to decoy selection. They combine measurable features into a single number indicator of decoy quality. Unfortunately, current scoring functions do not consistently select the best decoys. Machine learning techniques offer great potential to improve decoy scoring. This paper presents two machine-learning based scoring functions to predict the quality of proteins structures, i.e., the similarity between the predicted structure and the experimental one without knowing the latter. We use different metrics to compare these scoring functions against three state-of-the-art scores. This is a first attempt at comparing different scoring functions using the same non-redundant dataset for training and testing and the same features.

However, the exploitation of the high frequency or transient properties of the machine can advantageously be used to obtain additional information on the state variables of the machine like flux or rotor position or detection of possible fault conditions. Especially for the estimation of the flux or rotor position in induction machines the practical performance of the resulting control is strongly influenced by the lamination design. Modern design tools for induction machines only consider the fundamental wave and only few effort has been made until now to investigate the interaction of the fundamental wave design and the transient electrical behavior. This work is focused on these interactions. A transient simulation of the machine based on a magnetic equivalent circuit model including lamination material hysteresis is applied to ascertain the connection between saturated areas in the lamination material and the signals obtained from the evaluation of the machines transient electrical step response. To verify this connection as well as to quantify the influence measurements were performed on different machines with specific lamination design each concentrated on dominant saturation in a different area like tooth or yoke in the stator as well as in the rotor. A comparison of the simulation and measurement results of the machines at varying flux and load levels is given and the reasons for the difference in the transient signals is discussed taking the fundamental wave as well as the transient field distribution into account. Based on these results a model of the interaction of fundamental wave saturation and the transient control signals is established where the asymmetries caused by saturation at the different areas of the lamination are each represented by individual phasors. Adding up the phasors of all areas leads to the resulting asymmetry of the machine and gives its dependence on the point of operation.",

However, given$m$training patterns, a naive implementation of the QP solver takes$O(m^3)$training time and at least$O(m^2)$space. Hence, scaling up these QPs is a major stumbling block in applying kernel methods on very large data sets, and a replacement of the naive method for finding the QP solutions is highly desirable. Recently, by using approximation algorithms for the minimum enclosing ball (MEB) problem, we proposed the core vector machine (CVM) algorithm that is much faster and can handle much larger data sets than existing SVM implementations. However, the CVM can only be used with certain kernel functions and kernel methods. For example, the very popular support vector regression (SVR) cannot be used with the CVM. In this paper, we introduce the center-constrained MEB problem and subsequently extend the CVM algorithm. The generalized CVM algorithm can now be used with any linear\/nonlinear kernel and can also be applied to kernel methods such as SVR and the ranking SVM. Moreover, like the original CVM, its asymptotic time complexity is again linear in$m$and its space complexity is independent of$m$.

While the machine learning community is aware of the necessity to rigorously distinguish data transformation from data comparison and adopt reasonable combinations thereof, this awareness is often lacking in the field of comparative sequence analysis. With realization of the disadvantages of alignments for sequence comparison, some typical applications use more and more so-called alignment-free approaches. In light of this development, we present a conceptual framework for alignment-free sequence comparison, which highlights the delineation of: 1) the sequence data transformation comprising of adequate mathematical sequence coding and feature generation, from 2) the subsequent (dis-)similarity evaluation of the transformed data by means of problem-specific but mathematically consistent proximity measures. We consider coding to be an information-loss free data transformation in order to get an appropriate representation, whereas feature generation is inevitably information-lossy with the intention to extract just the task-relevant information. This distinction sheds light on the plethora of methods available and assists in identifying suitable methods in machine learning and data analysis to compare the sequences under these premises.",

The method is based on the two-axis dynamic model of a three-phase machine with wye-connected three-phase stator winding. The d-axis is defined with the magnetic axis of permanent magnets (\u201cflux linkage vector\u201d due to the permanent magnets), while the q-axis is displaced by electrical $\\pi\/2$. The tested machine is supplied by a controlled voltage source inverter. Voltage in one axis is changed in the stepwise manner, while current in the orthogonal axis is closed loop controlled. The characteristic flux linkage versus current in the form of a hysteresis loop is determined numerically using the time behavior of measured applied voltage and responding current in the same axis. Unfortunately, the currents induced in the machine's damping windings or squirrel cage disturb the flux linkage characteristic determined in this way. Therefore, only the final points of each hysteresis loop, where the currents induced in the damping windings already died-out, can be used as correct points of the machine's magnetically nonlinear iron core characteristic. The proposed method is confirmed by the tests performed with a single three-phase stator and four different rotors: the reluctance rotor, the reluctance rotor with squirrel cage, the reluctance rotor with inserted permanent magnets, and the reluctance rotor with inserted permanent magnets and squirrel cage.

        "660": "In this paper, a new method of aggregating decisions in a multi-support vector machine (SVM) ensemble system is proposed. The evidence theory is introduced to reduce the uncertainty of decision-making. In the evidence theory, a practical problem is how to determine the basic probability assignments. Usually they are evaluated subjectively by experts in advance. However, they may be far from the optimal values. Furthermore, in some cases where there is no expert knowledge, especially for aggregation in an ensemble learning system, they could not be evaluated as such. Due to the natural relation between the evidence theory and the rough sets theory, rough sets methods are applied so as to determine the basic probability assignments. The merit of the rough set theory is that it does not need any priori knowledge. Afterwards, the decisions of bagged and boosted SVMs are combined respectively by the evidence theory. Experimental results show that the presented multi-SVM system gains better performance over the popular ensemble learning methods such as Bagging and Adaboost.M1.",

Results show that the proposed low-pole dual-stator 6\/4 FSPM machine achieves a significant reduction of high-frequency losses including iron loss and magnet eddy current loss than the high-pole 12\/10 FSPM machine. Thus the dual-stator 6\/4 FSPM machine is more amenable for high-speed operation than the 12\/10 FSPM machine because of less fundamental frequency required, less total loss, and more energy savings.",
        "668": "Anisotropy-based initial rotor polarity detection of interior permanent-magnet synchronous machines (IPMSM) relies typically on the saturation in the stator iron. The current response to a voltage pulse into the north pole (d+) direction of the magnet should be higher in magnitude than into the opposite direction because of increased stator saturation. However, experiments show sometimes an opposite result. The present paper considers the bridge-saturation in the rotor to explain this phenomenon. Finite element (FE) analyses of six modified PMSM models demonstrate that the bridge-saturation decreases, as the flux linkage begins to increase. That leads to an increase of the differential inductance if the stator iron is not strongly saturated. The impact of the machine geometry parameters on the differential inductance is also studied in this paper by means of a sensitivity analysis.",

The partial cross-coupling model, which considers that the PM flux is a function of q-axis current and the d- and q-axis inductances are functions of d- and q-axis currents, respectively, is simple but neglects the saturation to some extent.

        "690": "Induction machines are used in a wide range of industrial applications due to their simplicity, ruggedness, and low cost. Despite their robustness, induction machines eventually fail at one point due to a variety of failure mechanisms. Many faults exhibit specific fault frequencies in the motor current spectrum, which allows for fault detection. Many classical fault detection methods have been developed for grid-connected machines with quasi-static operating points. In inverter-driven machines with a wide operating range, these methods cannot reliably detect and classify faults. Machine learning methods have been successfully used for various classification tasks. This work applies a combination of classical fault detection approaches with different fault classification algorithms to reliably detect induction machine faults over a wide operating range.The developed fault classification method is evaluated using steady-state measurements on an inverter-fed 5.5kW induction machine.

        "692": "Low voltage traction applications demand high torques at low speeds and at a small design space. In order to achieve high torque densities, manufacturers often combine high-speed machines with mechanical gearboxes. In the past decade, flux modulation machines came up, offering low speeds and high torque densities by utilizing the magnetic gearing effect. The idea is to remove the mechanical gear and get a compact direct drive solution. Now, the Vernier machines are a subgroup of the flux modulation machines. However, literature reports very poor power factors for Vernier machines in comparison to PM machines as the main drawback. Nevertheless, the presented studies always assume a fixed speed and only one single current operating point. This is correct for fixed speed applications, e.g. pumps and blowers, but it is not correct for traction applications, because the machine cycles dynamically through the torque-speed curve. Therefore, this paper first investigates the machine design requirements considering the machine control strategies and the needs of traction applications. Furthermore, a method to check if the design fulfills the given requirements by calculating only a single operating point is presented. In addition, the emerging differences between Vernier and PM machines are explained using analytic results. Furthermore, the paper presents a power factor comparison of torque optimized Vernier and PM machines while considering iron losses.

However, conventional methods estimate the rotor position from the fundamental flux linkages obtained by integrating the induced voltages. Therefore, response speed of the position estimation is slow compared to position sensorless control for permanent magnet synchronous machines and induction machines that estimates the rotor position without integration directly from induced voltages of the back electro-motive force (EMF) proportional to the machine speed. This paper proposes an adaptive observer based on model reference adaptive system to estimate the machine speed directly from induced voltages of the motional EMF. The direct speed estimation improves response speed of the position estimation compared to the conventional methods for SynRMs. Experimental investigation validated design of the adaptive observer and confirmed stable operation with speed acceleration and deceleration.

The constant-power operation regions of an SPM machine can be extended in an appealing fashion by taking advantage of the output voltage boost capability of the CSI. The CSI is naturally a boost-type converter, in contrast to the voltage source inverter (VSI) which has buck-type characteristics. To investigate the value of the CSI voltage boost feature, a new traction motor with higher rated voltage and lower rated current has been designed and compared to the motor that would be used with a VSI. The lower CSI current makes it possible to reduce the mass of the inverter and output power cable, benefiting power density and cost reduction. The SPM machine is modeled in the synchronous reference frame including the effect of the ac filter capacitors at the CSI output terminals.

Among the benefits that these machines present, they offer a number of design degrees of freedom. Furthermore, they can operate over a wide speed range, with a good flux weakening capability. One of the main challenges is to define a complete geometrical parametrization, in order to identify an optimal structure that satisfies the design requirements. In this paper, a detailed analysis of the rotor structure is carried out looking at understanding the effects of the geometrical parameters on key performance indexes (e.g. flux density harmonic content, torque capability, torque ripple, etc.). Based on the preliminary analysis, an optimization procedure is implemented for the design of a Nabla-shaped rotor to satisfy the electromechanical performance of a case study traction motor. The results are showing how an optimal machine can be designed with a reduced amount of permanent magnet, by optimizing the rotor structure.",
        "706": "This paper proposes direct stator flux oriented control for high performance interior mounted permanent magnet brushless AC (IPM-BLAC) drives and compares it with conventional indirect stator flux vector controlled schemes which are generally referred to as direct torque control (DTC). Torque angle is controlled indirectly in conventional DTC drives through a torque control loop or a torque-axis current control loop. This results in slow torque response and variation of torque control bandwidth with operating conditions due to highly non-linear relations between torque and torque angle or between torque-axis current and torque angle. More importantly, indirect control of the torque angle is compounded by stability conditions which are dependent on machine parameters and flux observer accuracy. The proposed control scheme yields linear and decoupled torque control characteristic, and hence improved robustness and dynamic response ensuring stable operation. Superiority of the proposed control scheme when compared to the state-of-theart schemes has been illustrated by experimental results of a 10kW IPM machine prototype drive designed for traction applications.",

        "708": "This paper investigates the principles underlying torque production in a flux-switching permanent-magnet (FSPM) machine. Because the phase windings and permanent magnets (PMs) in FSPM machines are both located on the stator, the torque production mechanism is not the same as for a conventional PM synchronous machine. Spatial harmonic analysis is applied to examine the frequency components present in the electric and magnetic loading of the machine. Since torque is proportional to the product of the electric and magnetic loading, understanding the source of the principal harmonics in these waveforms yields powerful insights into the components that result in torque production. The analysis is first presented for a specific FSPM machine (12-slot\/10-pole) and then extended to a general FSPM machine. The primary torque-producing harmonics in the air-gap flux density waveform are found to be the heterodyned harmonics of the magnetomotive force produced by the stator magnets and the air-gap permeance seen by the stator looking into the rotor. Analytical results are compared to results from finite-element analysis and exhibit good agreement.",
        "709": "The incident of fault conditions, especially bearing defects, in modern drives has increased. Bearing defect and the resulting asymmetry of the airgap is considered most difficult to detect especially under inverter operation. In order to develop and test monitoring methods it is necessary to carry out extensive measurements at various kinds and levels of eccentricity. As the air gap length of modern induction machines is in the range of a few tenth millimeters a very accurate mechanism to adjust any kind of eccentricity is needed. In this paper a test and measurement setup is described to accurately adjust and verify airgap asymmetries as well as to detect asymmetries under inverter operation. It is based on a set of eccentric rings to be placed in the bearing housings as well as on the rotor shaft. It turned out during the measurements that any industrially manufactured machine has a build in asymmetry in at least one of the different parts construction. As a result, it is still absolutely necessary to calibrate each single combination of machine housing and rotor even using very sophisticated production techniques. This verification is done primarily by a digital camera placed at different spots along the circumference of the air gap. Once the inherent asymmetries of the housing, lamination, and rotor are identified, this time consuming measurement can be replaced by a set of laser sensors placed at both sides of the machine at the rotor shaft. The performance of this setup is demonstrated by a sensitivity analysis of an asymmetry monitoring method. The analysis is done on a two pole induction machine. The monitoring method is based on a exploitation of the machines transient current slope due to the switching of the voltage source inverter.",

This study proposes an automated method to detect and quantify fQRS in a continuous way using features extracted from variational mode decomposition (VMD) and phase-rectified signal averaging (PRSA). Methods: In the proposed framework, QRS complexes in the ECG signals were first segmented using VMD. Then, ten VMD- and PRSA-based features were computed and fed into well-known classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayesian (NB), and TreeBagger (TB) in order to compare their performance.

The synchronous error causes mechanical cou-pling and makes the synchronous movement of the two pillars difficult. For this, the disturbance observer is designed in dual linear motor X-drifts of gantry-moving type boring-milling machining to limit the asynchronization caused by the parameters variation and external torques in this paper. Besides, load dynamic compensation of Y-drift is applied to decrease disturbance to X-drifts.

Different methods for sensorless control have been proposed in literature recently. To guarantee a stable operation in the whole fundamental frequency range including zero fundamental stator frequency, it is not enough to consider only the fundamental wave behaviour of the machine. All these methods have also to take into account side effects which are denoted as parasitic effects in normal operation of the machine but which are of high importance on the performance of control if the mechanical sensor is omitted. Their influence on the transient electrical behaviour of the machine is usually utilised by the mentioned schemes. To apply a sensorless control method on an induction motor drive it is thus necessary to know the coherence of machine design parameters and the signals obtained by the method. In this paper the influence of different types of stator winding schemes on the transient electrical behaviour of the machines is investigated reference to the use in sensorless control.

The function of AC sinusoidal current is to generate rotating magnetic field, and the excitation field is provided by the stationary DC bias current. By changing the value of DC bias current, we can adjust the allocation of DC bias and armature current flexibly, and improve the torque performance during flux weakening operation. The rotor is mechanically robust because it only has salient poles, and can modulate the air-gap flux because of the different permeance of air and iron pole.

Heterarchical, distributed, and modular control schemes are preferred to enhance the system reliability by eliminating single points of failure (SPOFs) from controllers. To facilitate modular machine control design and analysis, a generalized module-level machine analysis and modeling framework has been developed. Module-level machine analysis reveals intra-module unbalanced inductances and inter-module unbalanced cross-coupled fluxes that differ from conventional machines due to asymmetric mutual slot leakage flux couplings among the modules. An asymmetric module-level machine model has been developed by using complex vectors and conjugate complex vectors. Due to the asymmetry, balanced three-phase module voltage excitation induces both positive and negative sequence module current responses when the modules are not evenly loaded. This feature deteriorates the inter-module independence of MMDs, especially under fault conditions where maximum inter-module independence is desired. A modular control with a negative sequence regulator is proposed to eliminate the undesired negative sequence component under uneven loading and fault conditions in order to achieve the desired high level of inter-module independence.",

The placement of various coil sides in the slot and the difference in the field produced by different poles of the rotor magnet can influence the induced voltage in various coils and the impedance of the coils. The difference in the induced voltages in the various parallel paths results in circulating current in the winding and causes increased losses in the machine.

Based on a vectorial multimachine modelling that splits the multiphase machine in a set of magnetically independent fictitious machines, this approach allows to determine a pertinent control topology in case of pulse width modulation (PWM) voltage source inverter (VSI) supply. Design rules to reduce the parasitic currents and the torque ripples can also be deduced. This method is applied to improve the adaptation of a naval propulsion PM 5-phase machine to its converter. From a classical initial design with fully-pitched concentrated winding, the machine is improved by performing a new fractional-slot winding which drastically decreases the cogging torque. To make this winding possible, only the pole number has been modified (from 16 to 14). Iron, magnet and copper volumes are unchanged. For the two machines, a vector control to have sinusoidal currents is considered. For a same average torque, a decrease of the copper losses (less 35%) is observed mainly due to the reduction of parasitic currents. Furthermore a significant diminution (less 36%) of the torque ripples is obtained as a consequence of weakened interactions between the harmonics of the electromotive force and current. In comparison with the full-pitched concentrated winding, the fractional-slot winding improves significantly the torque quality (better density and lower ripples) and makes the current control easier without over-sizing the electronic components.",

Power Electron., vol. 30, no. 9, pp. 5036-5045, Sep. 2015] in responses to a few inquiries made by the readers. It is shown that due to parameter variations with stator currents, any technique for MTPA tracking based on piecewise constant parameter assumption, i.e., the machine parameters are assumed as constants during the calculation of \u2202Te\/\u2202\u03b2, would result in tracking error even though the machine parameters are obtained from lookup table or online machine parameter estimations. The error is dependent on machine nonlinear characteristics and operating conditions. It is also shown that for the prototype interior permanent magnet synchronous machine the virtual signal injection control technique described in the paper mentioned above yields a better tracking accuracy.",

However, despite of stator leakage flux, high rare-earth PM usage, PMFSM is subjected to slot effects due to presence of both PM and CAW in stator and partial saturation due to double salient structure which generates cogging torque (Tcog), torque ripples (Trip) and lower average torque (Tavg). To overcome aforesaid demerits, this paper presents Partitioned PM (PPM) Consequent Pole Flux Switching Machine (PPM-CPFSM) with flux barriers to enhance flux modulation, curtail PM usage and diminish stator leakage flux which reduces slotting effects and partial saturation to ultimately reduces Tcog and Trlp. In comparison with the existing state of the art, proposed PPM-CPFSM reduces 46.53% of the total PM volume and offer Tavg higher up to 88.8%, suppress Trlp maximum up to 24.8%, diminish Tcog up to 22.74% and offer 2.45 times Tden and Pden. Furthermore, torque characteristics of proposed PPM-CPFSM is investigated utilizing space harmonics injection i.e. inverse cosine, inverse cosine with 3rd harmonics and rotor pole shaping techniques i.e., eccentric circle, chamfering and notching. Detailed electromagnetic performance analysis reveals that harmonics injection suppressed Tcog maximum up to 83.5%, Trip up to 40.72% at the cost of 4.71% Tavg.

        "866": "Controlled induction motor drives without mechanical sensor at the motor shaft at low speed down to zero fundamental frequency can so far only be achieved by evaluating inherent saliencies of the induction machine. Similar to other sensorless methods based on signal injection, the resulting control signals of the indirect flux detection method by on-line reactance measurement is influenced, for example, by the saturation based saliency, the slotting saliency, and the anisotropy saliency as well as by load and flux level. Since these influences are extremely dependant on the machine design, they can hardly be calculated in advance and removed by filtering or digital signal processing. However the possibility of utilizing a neural network for learning the individual dependencies and removing the unwanted influences can provide a very satisfactory result. Since the easy implementation of a neural network does only use a small amount of calculation power, the algorithm can be implemented even in low-cost signal processors. Measurements on mechanical sensorless controlled induction machines present adequate results up to about rated load.",

        "872": "In many variable-torque applications of induction machines, it is desirable to operate the machine at high flux levels, thus allowing the machine to produce higher torques. This can lead to saturation of the main flux path, introducing cross-coupling effects which can severely disrupt the performance of controllers dependent on knowledge of the machine's magnetic parameters. Stator flux-oriented torque-control schemes need not depend on the magnetic parameters of the machine and, hence, are potentially more robust and easier to implement in magnetic saturation than rotor-flux-oriented control. In this paper, the authors present and analyze a stator-flux-oriented torque-control scheme. This controller only requires knowledge of the stator voltage, stator current, and stator resistance. An analytical expression for the maximum achievable torque output of the machine using a linear magnetics model is compared with values calculated using a nonlinear magnetics model incorporating saturation of the main flux path and is shown to be a good approximation at high flux levels, when the main flux path is heavily saturated. Experiments carried out on a 3 hp 1800 RPM wound-rotor induction machine show smooth operation of the control scheme at torque levels up to at least four times rated torque.",

In the case of wound rotor synchronous machines it is possible to obtain an accurate estimate of the speed by tracking the effect of the stator slots in the rotor current. For the rotor winding the stator slots represent a position dependent reluctance variation and therefore the rotor current will contain a harmonic component which is related to the rotor speed. The frequency of this harmonic component is tracked using an adaptive tracking filter and is then used to compensate for harmonics in the stator currents.

An SVM can act as a linear learning machine when handling data in a high dimensional feature space for non-linear separable and non-separable problems. A few methods have been proposed to solve two-class and multi-class classification problems by including fuzzy concepts. In this paper, we propose a new fuzzy support vector machine which improves the traditional SVM by adding fuzzy memberships to each training sample to indicate degree of membership of this sample to different classes. This fuzzy SVM is more complete and meaningful, and could generalize the traditional non-fuzzy SVM to a fuzzy one, i.e., the traditional non-fuzzy SVM is an extreme case of our fuzzy SVM when the degrees of membership of a sample to two different classes are the same.",

This presentation focuses on the effect of magnetic anisotropy which can show up in inverter fed operation and may deteriorate the performance if not considered. The manufacturing process with rolling and punching as well as the demand to reduce the sheet thickness in order to keep losses low support the emergence of an anisotropic distribution of the crystalline energy. Though the anisotropy is smaller than in grain oriented lamination material used in transformers it is still detectable as shown by measurements made on specimen discs. In the behavior of inverter fed ac machines this effect is seen in the transient current slope as shown by measurements performed on an especially manufactured induction machine. In the fundamental wave behavior anisotropy can hardly be detected. As modern drive control methods are mostly based on fundamental wave models it has not been considered up to now. However, in the past years first methods have been proposed to exploit also the high frequency and transient electrical behavior of induction machines, especially in the fields of mechanically sensorless control as well as condition monitoring.

In the first part the influence of these asymmetries on the transient electrical behavior of the machine is investigated by simulation results obtained from a magnetic equivalent circuit model. Starting from these results the proposed method is derived. It is based on the reaction of the machine current to voltage pulses caused by the switching of the inverter. The continuous switching of the inverter is necessary for the current control loop during normal operation of the drive. Using a special observer structure any changes in the reaction of the machine caused by airgap asymmetries can be detected and isolated. The only inputs necessary for the realization of the method are the DC link values of the voltage and the current. The observer estimates the transient parameters of the three phases and by comparing the three phase values an error signal can be calculated.

To address these issues, this paper studies the HIM based on the basic theoretical model and equations. First, the structure and magnetic circuit characteristics of HIM are introduced. Second, the mathematical model of HIM is derived and then decomposed, which indicates that the HIM can be seen as a WSM with large end leakage inductance when rotor tooth width \u03b8t \u2264 \u03c0\/p, or a combination of WSM and synchronous reluctance machine (SynRM) when \u03b8t > \u03c0\/p.

However, a drawback of the synchronous reluctance machine is the low power factor. Such a drawback is compensated by assisting the machine by means of a proper volume of PM material, generally Ferrite, which is introduced in the rotor flux-barriers. The PM flux saturates the rotor iron bridges, increases the power factor of the machine (which corresponds to a decrease of the Volt-Amps ratings of the inverter) and adds a PM flux torque component.

        "1033": "It is well established that various electrical machine manufacturing steps induce stresses which affect the magnetic properties of electrical steel laminations. Some of these stresses, such as those associated with cutting of the laminations, result in irreversible changes. In fact, punching and laser cutting, are frequently identified as the most severe cause of magnetic degradation [1]. Recent studies show that punching and laser cutting exhibit different deterioration mechanisms due to the nature of internal stresses they induce [2]. Namely, punching causes plastic deformation near the cut edge, whereas laser induces thermal stresses during cutting. In [2-3], the experimental characterization of the spatial distribution (i.e., edge-to-edge) of the magnetic degradation from the two cutting processes revealed that for punching a significant drop in permeability occurs near the cut edge. Whereas, in the case of laser cutting the damage seems to extend further from the edge due to the temperature gradient during processing, resulting in a substantial permeability reduction over the total sample width. The intensity of degradation was strongly influenced by the geometry of the sample, i.e., the strip width and thickness. Therefore, it is important to understand and model such complex phenomena in order to predict their influence on the performance of electrical machines. Discrepancies between predictions and measurements are frequently observed and reported in the literature. For instance, for the case of iron loss these are reported as \u201cbuilt-factors\u201d. Such an approach neglects to reflect the link between the machine design geometrical details and the degree of electrical steel degradation [1]. The quantification of the effects of the magnetic degradation of electrical steel laminations on the machine's flux or back-EMF has received little attention in the literature (to date).",

For a low power industrial drives, currently utilized with an induction machine, a salient pole and a flux barrier reluctance rotor are designed to replace the squirrel cage rotor at lower machine costs. Both rotors are built up and implemented in the common three phase stator. The rotor change for this drive is proposed, because generally a higher attention of electric machine's efficiency is set to the part load region according to the latest IEC standards. The machine parameters as well as the torque and power characteristic are discussed and finally the machine efficiency is analyzed by measurements. As expected from the finite element analysis the salient pole rotor provides a higher power than the flux barrier type, especially at higher speeds. The salient pole machine prototype is able to fulfill the required power characteristic of the application, but the flux barrier machine does not. Additionally, the salient pole rotor shows a higher part load efficiency. From the loss analysis a high loss portion is identified as the mechanical friction loss, which dramatically limits the machine efficiency for both rotors.

Like the SPSM, the DFIM faces radial electromagnetic forces due to the non-sinusoidal airgap magnetic flux density. However these forces are not necessarily the same as the ones existing in the original SPSM essentially because of the different magnetic circuit properties. Vibration problems, due to matching between exciting force and stator eigen-mode, may occur in the DFIM although they did not exist in the original SPSM. The risk is even more relevant considering that the DFIM operates at different speeds, so that it leads to a shift in frequency in some force components.",

Magnet properties are known to be dependent on temperature; therefore, the magnet temperature effects on magnetization manipulation and maximum torque properties in VF-PMSMs are investigated in this paper with FEA simulations and experiments. Increased magnet temperature changes the available range of attainable magnetization levels and makes demagnetization occur more easily; therefore, a different current angle and magnetization are needed for maximum torque operation.

Every year, illimitable cases remain pending just for the final hearing of judicial verdict. Years pass-by keeping the plaintiff waiting for justice. For years, this is a major issue faced in the Indian judicial system. In this paper, authors have attempted to condense the problem by decreasing the number of cases before it reaches the Court.

(ii) Data set are generated manually based on certain parameters like:(a) `Victim Name' (b) `Number of years married (greater than seven years or not)'. In India, these parameters determine the key factors of `Dowry' related cases. If the case is filed within seven years of marriage and the defendant has taken dowry then the case falls under `dowry case' else not (c) `Dowry taken within seven years of marriage (Yes\/No)' (d) `Incident occurred within seven years of marriage', this parameter shows that if the death has taken place within seven years of marriage it falls under 'Dowry Death' case.

        "1165": "This paper describes the merits of a recently developed form of a three-phase permanent-magnet (PM) brushless AC machine in which the concentrated coils of each stator phase are wound either on adjacent teeth or on alternate teeth. Such a machine is often referred to as modular and offers a number of significant advantages over conventional PM brushless machines. For example, it results in a smaller number of slots for a given number of poles, which is a distinct manufacturing advantage, and yields a fractional number of slots per pole, which is conducive to low cogging torque. It also enables a significant increase in the achievable machine inductance to facilitate constant power operation over a wide speed range by flux weakening. However, the torque in modular machines is developed by the interaction of a high-order stator space harmonic MMF with the PMs, since the fundamental stator MMF has fewer poles than the PM rotor. Hence, significant eddy currents may be induced in the rotor by the fundamental and low-order space harmonic MMFs. The eddy-current loss can, however, be reduced by segmenting the magnets. Given that modular machines combine the high specific power and efficiency of conventional PM brushless machines with a high machine inductance, to enable a wide speed range, constant power operation, their potential for low manufacturing cost, and the fact that they have inherently low cogging torque, they are eminently suitable for in-wheel traction applications.",

The system space vector control is realized through controlling the master system by measuring the six-phase currents and Vdc voltage. The simulation results are used to verify this new control method.",

The HAM consists of a strong coupling between the reluctance network and the Fourier series solution of magnetic scalar potential. In order to assess the merits and capabilities of the HAM, it is applied to the study of the cogging force in linear machines and compared with finite element analyses (FEA). The cogging force is a global quantity, which is very sensitive to magnetic field computation accuracy and constitutes, therefore, a good measure of the accuracy of the HAM as compared with FEA. The HAM should require less computation time as compared with FEA, and is then more suitable for predesign stage. Three different structures are analyzed: a flat linear machine, a TLPM with internal mobile armature, and, finally, a TLPM with external mobile armature. The analyses are conducted, considering the effect of magnetic saturation.",

        "1177": "Advances in electrostatic machine design have enhanced the torque density of macroscale electrostatic machines toward practical use. A recently developed fractional horsepower three-phase separately excited synchronous electrostatic machine (SEM) demonstrates torque densities comparable to those of air-cooled permanent-magnet-based electromagnetic machines (1.5 Nm\/kg) when excited with a medium voltage (5 kV). SEMs develop torque from voltage, not from current, and therefore incur nearly zero losses at low speeds or stall. However, there is no off-the-shelf medium-voltage drive at this power level, and the appropriate control framework for these machines has yet to be established. This article presents a complex vector voltage regulator control approach as a means for modulating torque in an SEM. Ampere-second (charge) is sourced from a current source inverter (CSI) serving as the drive electronics for voltage regulation. Together, the control approach and the CSI hardware form the first high-performance electrostatic drive. Key research outcomes include the theoretical development and experimental verification of charge-oriented control via voltage regulation. Experimental results are presented for rotational and stall conditions, which are reflective of the \u201cposition and hold\u201d applications suited to electrostatic machines. The dynamic performance of the voltage regulator is verified by measuring the controller frequency response function, dynamic stiffness, and command tracking on a separately excited SEM.",

Furthermore, severity of the aforementioned faults is estimated. The algorithm is evaluated in two inverter drives: field-oriented control and direct torque control. The proposed method is based on the frequency spectrum of the instantaneous reactive power obtained by the fast Fourier transform. The spectral components of reactive power are used as features for detection and classification.

Since the permanent magnets in a FSPM machine are on the stator, rather than on the rotor as in the conventional PM machines, the iron loss exists not only in the stator but also in the rotor, while its calculation becomes more difficult due to complex flux density waveforms. A more accurate model for the iron loss calculation is proposed for the FSPM machine, with due consideration of the influence of operation conditions, including constant torque and flux-weakening. Finite element predicted open-circuit flux waveforms and iron loss are validated experimentally.",

In this paper, an analytical calculation of permanent-magnet synchronous machines is proposed using saturation-dependent poleform coefficients for the inductances Ld and Lq and the permanent flux \u03c8m. The poleform coefficients are determined using Finite Element Software. Cross Saturation between d- and q-axis can also be taken into consideration.",
        "1184": "This paper investigates the effects of loading on radial magnetic forces in a low-speed PM machine with non-overlapping concentrated windings. Vibration level of the PM machines with concentrated windings can be potentially higher compared to the traditional machines with distributed windings. It is mainly due to the presence of low order harmonics in the spatial distribution of the radial forces. In this paper, magnetic flux density distribution in the airgap of a 120-slot\/116-pole machine is computed using finite element method (FEM). Maxwell's stress tensor method is then employed to calculate radial and tangential forces in the airgap. Flux density, radial and tangential force distributions are studied in different loading conditions and the effect of d-axis and q-axis currents are investigated. It is found that d-axis current can significantly change the amplitude of the lowest spatial harmonic of radial force distribution and consequently the vibration behavior. Experimental tests are carried out to compare the vibration level of the prototype PM generator supplying resistive, inductive and capacitive loads.",

This method is able to capture both in-plane and out-of-plane modal behavior along with local effects, such as tooth bending. The model relies on fitting unitary force-shape responses to transfer function models using a zero-pole representation. These frequency response functions are obtained from applying the vibration synthesis process to a series of finite-element (FE) stator models that have material properties updated using the experimental modal analysis. The obtained zeros and poles are used to construct three lookup table models with their accuracy varying between the three of them with the number of samples used in the data generation process. The accuracy of these models is validated at the unitary force-shape response level using four stator FE model samples. Also, at the run-up vibration spectrogram level, the models are validated, with good results, using radial and tangential force excitation obtained from an updated electromagnetic FE model of an interior permanent magnet (PM) synchronous machine designed for electric power steering.

The proposed algorithm does not use the voltage magnitude as a feedback signal, but utilizes the voltage differences between the input and the output of the over-modulation block, and to detect the maximum torque per voltage line, the q-axis voltage, which is the output of the q-axis current regulator, is used. The available maximum output torque by the proposed algorithm in the flux weakening region is closed to that by the six step operation, while the ability of the current control is still maintained.

An important issue in such effort is the modelling of the induction machine including rotor bar and end-ring faults, with a minimum of computational complexity. In this paper, it is introduced a new and simpler approach for the modelling and computer simulation of induction machines with rotor asymmetries.

When the high frequency fluctuating signal is injected in the terminal of an induction machine, the difference of impedance between the d-axis and q-axis of the synchronous rotating reference frame can be measured. This phenomenon is explained by a high frequency model of the induction machine, which is oriented with a high frequency signal space vector. The rotor flux angle can thus be tracked by tuning the space vector of the high frequency signal. Experimental results are provided to verify that this algorithm is robust against parameters variations and load changes.",
        "1190": "Machining systems (i.e., machine tools, cutting processes and their interaction) cannot produce accurate parts if performance degradation due to wear in their subsystems (e.g., feed-drive systems and spindle units) is not identified, monitored and controlled. Appropriate maintenance actions delay the possible deterioration and minimize\/avoids the machining system stoppage time that leads to lower productivity and higher production cost. Moreover, measuring and monitoring machine tool condition has become increasingly important due to the introduction of agile production, increased accuracy requirements for products and customers' requirements for quality assurance. Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) practices, such as vibration monitoring of machine tool spindle units, are therefore becoming a very attractive, but still challenging, method for companies operating high-value machines and components. CBM is being used to plan for maintenance action based on the condition of the machines and to prevent failures by solving the problems in advance as well as controlling the accuracy of the machining operations. By increasing the knowledge in this area, companies can save money through fewer acute breakdowns, reduction in inventory cost, reduction in repair times, and an increase in the robustness of the manufacturing processes leading to more predictable manufacturing. Hence, the CBM of machine tools ensures the basic conditions to deliver the right ability or capability of the right machine at the right time. One of the most common problems of rotating equipment such as spindles is the bearing condition (due to wear of the bearings). Failure of the bearings can cause major damage in a spindle. Vibration analysis is able to diagnose bearing failures by measuring the overall vibration of a spindle or, more precisely, by frequency analysis. Several factors should be taken into consideration to perform vibration monitoring on a machine tool's spindle. Some of these factors are as follows: the sensor type\/sensitivity, number of sensors to be installed on the spindle in different directions, positioning of the vibration accelerometers, frequency range to be measured, resonance frequency, spindle rotational speed during the measurements, measurement condition, including the no-load condition with tool clamped or without a tool, measuring tools and technologies, automatic or manual run of measurement, measurement routine, warning limits, and data handling and analysis, among other factors. The aim of this paper is thus to address CBM and particularly the implementation in the manufacturing industries focusing on the use of vibration monitoring techniques to monitor the condition of the machine tools' spindle units. To conduct this study, a pilot project was followed in real time. The pilot project was performed at a manufacturing company in Sweden. The company's product is gearboxes for the automotive industry, with a production volume of approximately 135,000 units per year. CBM, by online and off-line condition monitoring, using vibration monitoring, has been implemented on different types of machine tools, including horizontal and vertical turning machines, multi-task milling machines and grinding machines.",

Field-oriented control of high speed machines meets a number of challenges: strong cross-coupling between orthogonal components of the voltage and current vectors, great variation of machine parameters during operation, an exceptionally negative influence of a delay and dead-time on the control stability and a short switching period available for the execution of the digital control. This paper gives rigorous representation of a control system with a high-speed permanent magnet synchronous machine in the rotating reference system. Two different methods of decoupling the current control are analyzed; especially, the effects of parameter variation and delay in the control loop are taken into account. The paper uses the development of a vector controller for a high-speed micro-turbine generator as a test case.",

For the design of reliable electrical machines, it is therefore becoming increasingly important to analyze these voltage stresses in the winding system in more detail in order to design a correspondingly robust insulation system that can withstand the stresses. Of high importance is the modeling of transient overvoltages, which can be many times the DC link voltage and are a common cause of partial discharges that damage the insulation system of electrical machines. Since in hairpin windings the position of each conductor is known special precautions can be taken to prevent transient overvoltages. In this paper, a universally valid and automatable methodology is presented to model the voltage distribution in hairpin windings and identify transient overvoltages.",
        "1195": "In this article, an online rotor position error correction method is proposed to eliminate the impact of parameter mismatch in sensorless control for dual three-phase (DTP) permanent magnet synchronous machines drives. The rotor position error production mechanism is first derived and shows that the error changes with the trend of current variation when there is a parameter mismatch. Based on this mechanism, by injecting sinusoidal current signals with low frequency and small amplitude into both sets of three-phase windings, the presence of parameter mismatch and its level can be revealed from the corresponding sinusoidal responses of the estimated speed of sensorless observers, which do not depend on the inertia of the machine. Since the amplitudes of these responses decrease as the parameter mismatch level reduces, with the help of the least mean square algorithm, the parameters can be adaptively adjusted to the actual values, and the position error can be thus corrected. Moreover, with the extra freedom of DTP machines, the detrimental effects on torque production due to current signal injections can be eliminated through adjusting the phase between the two injected signals. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been validated through simulation and experimental results.",
        "1196": "We investigated the longitudinal ends' influence on the flux distribution in a permanent-magnet linear synchronous machine with an analytic model and with numeric finite-element methods. We derived a general analytic expression, on closed form, from a linear reluctance model. The model reveals that the flux in a linear machine differs from that in a rotating machine in several aspects. The longitudinal ends introduce a pairwise coupled flux pattern, which will behave differently in circuits with odd or even numbers of magnets. In linear machines with an even number of magnets the pairwise coupled flux will spread throughout the whole machine, whereas in linear machines with an odd number of magnets it will be transformed into an equally distributed flux in the middle. The latter case will give rise to a nonsymmetric air gap flux distribution, where every second pole has larger flux. We confirmed the pairwise coupled flux and the nonsymmetric air gap distribution predicted by the analytic model by finite-element simulations. We noted additional effects when nonlinear behavior of the steel is taken into account. We conclude that saturation counteracts the pairwise coupled flux pattern at the longitudinal ends. Again, a nonsymmetric air gap flux distribution occurs as the pairwise coupled flux is transformed into an equally coupled flux. The pairwise coupling of the flux and the nonsymmetric air gap flux distribution give rise to a number of secondary effects, which we discuss.",

Prior studies usually focus on the issue of placing virtual machines that are assumed to be isolated to each other. This paper addresses the problem of deploying virtual machine clusters on the compute pool, in which a virtual machine cluster refers to a set of virtual machines hosting a virtualized distributed system\/application. In the case that the virtualized distributed system\/application is too large to fit in a single physical machine, the virtual machine cluster has to be partitioned into several subsets and to be placed on several physical machines. Without considering the relationship among VMs in a virtual machine cluster, two VMs that frequently communicate with each other can be placed far away, and consequently lead to poor performance. To this end, we propose a novel placement approach for virtual machine clusters that tries to minimize the Inter-VMs network traffic. The simulation results indicate that the proposed approach consumes the smallest physical network bandwidth while comparing with several existing virtual machine placement algorithms.",

However, the lack of schemes to completely characterize M2M network topology, to efficiently share radio resource, and to provide quality-of-service (QoS) guarantee regarding end-to-end delay creates challenges to practically facilitate M2M communications. Via mathematical derivations, the network connectivity, degree distribution, and average distance are provided for large M2M networks. To achieve reliable communications upon such M2M networks, inspired by cognitive radio technology and cooperative communications, a cognitive and opportunistic relay (COR) scheme is proposed. Specifically, machines with the proposed COR autonomously sense the primary systems\u2019 spectrum usage so as to mitigate detractive interference and adopt opportunistic forwarder selection for lower link delay of packet transmissions. Furthermore, by analytical deriving the effective capacity of the COR over connected M2M networks, the throughput under statistical QoS guarantee and the corresponding delay violation probability are proposed to specify the QoS guarantee capability of the networks and thus suggest the conditions of dependable end-to-end transmissions. Simulation results confirm that the proposed COR effectively achieves the delay guarantee performance, to yield a novel framework for facilitating reliable M2M communications in large machine networks.",

Approaches for sensorless control of PMSMs use the stator as the transmitter and as the receiver of the carrier signal. A new alternative for wound rotor synchronous machines is to use the field winding as the transmitter and the stator as receiver. Since the field inductance is usually very large, a signal injection into the rotor is not reasonable because large rotor voltages are obligatory to create detectable stator currents. Therefore the presented approaches make use of the switching of the dc-field chopper as a carrier signal. Two methods are compared: The first method evaluates the stator currents in rotor fixed coordinates using a tracking observer. The second one uses the stator currents in stator fixed coordinates to directly compute the rotor position. Both methods consider cross saturation effects. In contrast to approaches for carrier signal based sensorless control of PMSMs no differential magnetic saliency is mandatory. Moreover no additional signal injection is necessary.

By increasing the amplitude of the negative d-axis current, the resulting increase in the stator copper losses can be more than offset by the reduction in the iron core losses achieved by lowering the stator d-axis flux amplitude. The effectiveness of this technique has been demonstrated using both analytical models and finite element analysis (FEA) for a 55 kW (peak) surface PM machine design developed for a demanding set of traction drive performance requirements. For this example, the modified control strategy increases the partial-load efficiency at 20% of rated torque by >6% at 2000 rpm compared to the maximum torque\/amp algorithm, making the machine much more attractive for its intended application",

        "1258": "In this article, a novel current control strategy is proposed to manipulate the magnetization state of the variable flux memory machine (VFMM) through a newly developed linear active-disturbance-rejection-based feedforward current controller. A linear extended state observer is designed to estimate the sum of the permanent magnet (PM) induced voltage and the disturbance voltage caused by the susceptible machine parameters to compensate for the linear state error feedback output. The voltage across the winding resistance and the cross-coupling voltage are calculated by the voltage equations and fed forward to the output of the current controller. Meanwhile, the magnetizing current pulse amplitude can be determined by the target PM flux linkage obtained by looking up the table according to the mechanical speed. Since the q-axis disturbance voltage can commonly be ignored during the steady operation, the q-axis observed voltage after low-pass filtering can be directly utilized to estimate the PM flux linkage, which is compared with the target PM flux linkage to determine whether the current manipulation is needed to achieve online remagnetization or demagnetization. Experimental measurements on a hybrid-magnetic-circuit VFMM verify the effectiveness and superiorities of the proposed current control strategy.",

        "1263": "Being much more rugged than a rotor made of traditional steel sheets, a solid rotor is frequently used in high-power high-speed induction machines (IMs). Furthermore, by a solid-rotor machine, a higher rotating speed can be achieved. However, the solid rotor also has certain disadvantages, the relatively high solid-rotor eddy-current losses being the most serious one. Basically, solid-rotor eddy-current losses are mainly induced by time-spatial air-gap flux density high-order harmonics. The suppression of the high-order harmonics is the key means to mitigate the rotor eddy-current losses. In this paper, a novel computational model is proposed for evaluating the rotor harmonic eddy-current losses of a 2 MW, 12 000 r\/min IM. The model was built on a special machine referred to as a virtual permanent magnet harmonic machine (VPMHM). The model was constructed by applying the finite-element method (FEM), and it is based on the time-spatial harmonics produced by a rotating magnet with sinusoidal magnetization. The VPMHM model links the air-gap flux density harmonics directly to the specific rotor eddy-current losses. Furthermore, according to the proposed model, three options, namely, the use of air-gap permeance modifying notches on the stator teeth, semimagnetic wedges, and their combination, were investigated in detail for mitigating the rotor eddy-current losses in the motor nominal operating point. The results and conclusions in this paper are based on the FEM analysis.",

Herein, over-constrained VMs are defined as those who are not given sufficient system resources to meet their workload specific objective functions. To validate our approach, a variety of workload-specific benchmarks inspired by common Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud workloads were used. Workloads were run while regularly sampling VM resource consumption features exposed by the hypervisor. Datasets were curated into nominal or over-constrained and used to train ML classifiers to determine VM over-constraint rules based on one-time workload analysis. Rules learned on one host are transferred with the VM to other host environments to determine portability. Key contributions of this work include: demonstrating which VM resource consumption metrics (features) prove most relevant to learned decision trees in this context, and a technique required to generalize this approach across hosts while limiting required up front training expenditure to a single VM and host. Other contributions include a rigorous explanation of the differences in learned rulesets as a function of feature sampling rates, and an analysis of the differences in learned rulesets as a function of workload variation.

A machine model including the considered short-circuit faults is implemented using finite element method to analyze the system behavior.

This paper presents a new method to optimize the key parameters of the machine under keeping the torque of the machine as large as possible by controlling the stator current. Nonlinear optimization and functional analysis are used to obtain the maximal torque at a certain speed. The investigation of many groups of the parameter data shows that the performance of a machine is influenced by various factors such as magnetic materials, the quantities of the material in the rotor, the turns of windings in the stator and so on.

The proposed design aims to reduce the cost of permanent magnet machines by minimizing the use of expensive high-grade rare earth magnet materials without compromising the high performance associated with them. The decreased performance due to the reduced rare earth magnet content can be compensated by adding inexpensive ferrite magnets. The design was optimized to achieve maximum cost-savings by minimizing the rare earth magnet content and improving the saliency of the rotor structure. A comparative study was conducted to highlight the advantages of the proposed concept using the Camry 2007 model as the baseline design. The results show that the proposed design is capable of achieving the same torque and power density as the baseline design using 30% less rare earth magnet materials, resulting in 20% active material cost reduction.

The good generalization ability of SVMs is achieved by finding a large margin between two classes. The theory of SVMs has been shown to provide higher performance than traditional learning machines in many applications. However, there are some limitations which restrict its application, for example, it is required every input must be labelled and exactly assigned to one of these two classes without any uncertainty. Sometimes these requirements are too restrictive to be used in practice. In this paper, suppose we are given a set of datasets in which only part of the two-class data is labelled. The labelled input may not exactly belong to any one, but belong to the positive class with a certain probability and\/or also belong to the negative class with a certain probability.

As the application of the commonly employed spectrum analysis techniques is complicated by the inverter drives inherent frequency variation, the Vienna Monitoring Method avoids any frequency analysis and observes instead the machine state with the help of on-line models. The key for the fault detection is thereby the comparison of the estimated machine states out of two independent machine models with different model structures. While the models respond identically to the regular machine operation they diverge in case of a structural machine asymmetry. Experimental results from an IGBT drive show that a single rotor bar resistance change can be detected unequivocally.

        "1344": "Soft Tissue Tumors (STT) are a form of sarcoma found in tissues that connect, support, and surround body structures. Because of their shallow frequency in the body and their great diversity, they appear to be heterogeneous when observed through Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). They are easily confused with other diseases such as fibroadenoma mammae, lymphadenopathy, and struma nodosa, and these diagnostic errors have a considerable detrimental effect on the medical treatment process of patients. Researchers have proposed several machine learning models to classify tumors, but none have adequately addressed this misdiagnosis problem. Also, similar studies that have proposed models for evaluation of such tumors mostly do not consider the heterogeneity and the size of the data. Therefore, we propose a machine learning-based approach which combines a new technique of preprocessing the data for features transformation, resampling techniques to eliminate the bias and the deviation of instability and performing classifier tests based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree (DT) algorithms. The tests carried out on dataset collected in Nur Hidayah Hospital of Yogyakarta in Indonesia show a great improvement compared to previous studies. These results confirm that machine learning methods could provide efficient and effective tools to reinforce the automatic decision-making processes of STT diagnostics.",

Among freshwater resources, human drinkable water resources account for only 0.3 % of them. In Africa, hundreds of thousands of people fall ill or even die from drinking unclean water every year. If the water potability can be predicted accurately, then it can save a lot of the human, material and financial resources of the country and the region on the drinkability of water resources, which is an important step for the application of machine learning in water resources monitoring.

        "1354": "Usually skin effect is neglected in the design of medium speed machines when using random wound windings. That is because it is thought that parallel strands mix enough so that the skin effect can be neglected. In medium speed machines operating in the frequency range of 100 - 300 Hz the skin effect problem may come up in cases where the slots have only one or a couple of turns despite the fact that the turn has been divided into many parallel sub-conductors. Tests were carried out with 310 kW medium speed machines with nominal frequency of 200 Hz. One of the machines was wound in a normal way and the other machine was wound by twisting the strands in the coil-end areas (not line-end) by 180 degrees. It is shown that taking care of the transpose of parallel wires in a coil, skin effect and losses remain tolerable.

Such measures facilitate comparing designs not only for rated conditions, but also allow to analyze their performance in the presence of unevitable tolerances. Consequently, by additionally considering reliability or robustness as objectives compared to conventional optimization scenarios, designs featuring low parameter sensitiveness can be obtained. The analysis of the design's reliability as part of solving optimization problems involves a significant increase in required numerical evaluations. To minimize the associated prolongation of the runtime, an approach featuring a design of experiments based reduction of required computations and a consequent surrogate modeling technique is presented here. After successful training, the metamodel can be applied for fast evaluating lots of different parameter combinations. A test problem is defined and analyzed. Based on the observed findings, the necessity of incorporating robustness evaluations to machine design optimization becomes evident. In addition, the derived models allow for studying the impact of any tolerance-affected parameter on the machine performance in detail.

We present a machine learning (ML) workflow to drug discovery or repositioning by predicting indication for a particular disease based on drug expression profiles, with a focus on applications in psychiatry. Drugs that are not originally indicated for the disease but with high predicted probabilities serve as candidates for repurposing. This approach is widely applicable to any chemicals or drugs with expression profiles measured, even if drug targets are unknown. It is also highly flexible as virtually any supervised learning algorithms can be used. We employed the ML approach to identify repositioning opportunities for schizophrenia as well as depression and anxiety disorders. We applied various state-of-the-art ML approaches, including deep neural networks (DNNs), support vector machines (SVMs), elastic net regression, random forest, and gradient boosted trees. The predictive performance of the five approaches in cross validation did not differ substantially, with SVM slightly outperforming the others. However, other methods also reveal literature-supported repositioning candidates of different mechanisms of actions. As a further validation, we showed that the repositioning hits are enriched for psychiatric medications considered in clinical trials.

In this paper, we analyze the feasibility of using trunk sway data and machine learning (ML) techniques to automatically evaluate balance, providing accurate assessments outside of the clinic. We recruited sixteen participants to perform standing balance exercises. For each exercise, we recorded trunk sway data and had a PT rate balance performance on a scale of 1-5. The rating scale was adapted from the Functional Independence Measure. From the trunk sway data, we extracted a 61-dimensional feature vector representing the performance of each exercise. Given these labeled data, we trained a multi-class support vector machine (SVM) to map trunk sway features to PT ratings. Evaluated in a leave-one-participant-out scheme, the model achieved a classification accuracy of 82%. Compared to participant self-assessment ratings, the SVM outputs were significantly closer to PT ratings. The results of this pilot study suggest that in the absence of PTs, ML techniques can provide accurate assessments during standing balance exercises. Such automated assessments could reduce PT consultation time and increase user compliance outside of the clinic.",

Effective classifiers have been regarded as a critical topic, with the related departments striving to collect huge amounts of data to avoid making the wrong decision. Finding effective classifier is important because it will help people make an objective decision instead of them having to rely merely on intuitive experience. This study proposes two well-known classifiers, namely, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), which will be used to find the highest accuracy rate classifier without features selection. Two credit data sets from University of California, Irvine (UCI) are chosen to evaluate the accuracy of various classifiers.

For the accurate prediction of the performances of saturated synchronous machines, the saturation characteristics in both the direct and quadrature axes are needed. The d-axis saturation characteristic of a synchronous machine can be measured easily by the open-circuit test with the machine excited from its field winding. On the other hand, the q-axis saturation characteristic of a synchronous machine cannot be measured applying a similar easy, simple method and, as a result, these characteristics are usually not experimentally measured and are not available. In this paper, three possible experimental methods for determining the q-axis saturation characteristics of both cylindrical-rotor and salient-pole synchronous machines are presented. The merits and demerits of these experimental methods are discussed from the point of view of their complexity and their accuracy. Comparisons between the measured q-axis saturation characteristics obtained by these experimental methods are made for a cylindrical-rotor machine and two salient-pole machines. Moreover, the various sources of errors which may affect the accuracy of determining the q-axis saturation characteristics by these methods are investigated.",

However, they require careful modelling because of strong anisotropies of the rotor, as they are also known from salient-pole synchronous machines. These anisotropies are often accounted for by different values for the d-axis and q-axis inductances in a rotor-flux-oriented coordinate system. With regard to asynchonous machine control, stator-flux-oriented control could provide improved dynamic behaviour - especially in the field-weakening range. The representation of fault conditions inside the machine, leading to asymmetrical machine parameters, suggests a phase-wise description instead of the usual two-axis (d-q or space-vector) analysis. This paper presents a machine model which provides a basis for stator-flux-oriented control and for the simulation of fault conditions inside the machine. This is reached by a phase-wise representation based on the known approach using rotor-flux-oriented d-axis and q-axis inductances. A physical interpretation for self and mutual inductances is given. A single-phase winding interruption fault is simulated to outline the capability of the chosen approach.",

These advantages make it suitable for low-cost variable speed applications. However, single-phase DCFSMs requires accurate position feedback from a position sensor to generate smooth torque. The position sensor such as an encoder is not permitted in the low-cost applications due to its high cost. To eliminate the position sensor, this paper presents a novel sensorless control scheme for single-phase DCFSMs. Rotor position is estimated with the position-dependent armature current ripple induced by injecting high-frequency square-wave voltage to the field winding at standstill and low speeds. At medium and high speeds, armature mutual flux linkage is calculated and used to estimate the rotor position. A seamless transition between these two methods is achieve by mixing the calculated position error signals as the input for a single position estimator. The experimental results show that with the proposed scheme, the single-phase DCFSM can accelerate from standstill to the rated speed with 50% load, and to the maximum speed with 25% load, respectively.",

        "1389": "This paper presents an online feedback-based (FB) field weakening (FW) control technique for interior permanent magnet (IPM) brushless AC (BLAC) machines with due accounting for nonlinear machine parameters and inverter characteristics in traction applications. The proposed method computes the dq-axis current references online instead of employing predefined look-up tables (LUT) as in the conventional schemes. Thus, it provides the flexibility for online parameter update or estimation to enhance the drive system efficiency. It is shown that in the FB-based FW operation where the machine voltage magnitude is maintained at the voltage hexagon boundary via the voltage FB loop using the ideal FB voltage references which the nonlinear inverter characteristics are neglected, the stator flux reference regulated via the voltage FB loop may not be optimally controlled due to the mismatch between the ideal demand and actual voltages applied to the IPM BLAC machine. For a given torque, it results in a higher current magnitude than the ideal demand, and therefore leads to extra copper losses. To solve this problem, a nonlinear inverter compensation (NIC) method is proposed and experimentally validated by measurements on a 10kW IPM BLAC drive. It is shown that by incorporating the proposed NIC technique, the achievable torque under a given speed can be increased up to 4% and the copper losses under a torque demand and given speed can be reduced up to 4% in the FW operation region.",

To ensure ubiquity in connections across all machines, it is necessary to have a standard infrastructure, such as 3GPP LTE-A network infrastructure, that facilitates such type of communications. However, owing to the huge scale of machines to be deployed in near future and the nature of data transactions, ensuring ubiquitous connections among all the machines will be difficult. Solutions that not only maintain connectivity but also route machine data in a cost effective manner are the need of the hour. In this context, it has been suggested that Device-to-Device (D2D) communication can play a very important role in expanding network coverage and routing the data between source-destination machine pairs. In this paper, we conduct a feasibility study to highlight the impact of multi-hop D2D communication in increasing the network coverage and average rate of a Machine Type Communication (MTC) device. We present a stochastic geometry based framework to analyze the coverage probability and average data rate of a three-hop M2M network deployed along with User Equipments (UEs) and conduct extensive simulations to study the system performance. Our simulation results show that the three-hop M2M network formed from out-of-range MTC devices and UEs can significantly improve the coverage and average rate of the entire network. Due to the mobility of users in the network, design of robust routing mechanisms in such a time evolving network becomes difficult.

Leveraging the fact that it is the quality of the data that matters to the application rather than the link qualities of individual machines, data-centric machine-to-machine (M2M) communications prioritize machines based on the importance of data they carry to optimize system design. In this paper, we investigate the use of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique for data-centric M2M wireless networks. In particular, we focus on the problem of how machines should be paired for resource sharing during transmission scheduling. We have found that the conventional NOMA scheduling strategy to maximize the sum data rates of co-scheduled users can result in worse performance than OMA (orthogonal multiple access) for data-centric communications. To address the problem, we propose a scheduling strategy to minimize the waiting time among co-scheduled users by taking into consideration the amount of data to transmit and achievable data rates of NOMA users. Evaluation results show that such a scheduling strategy performs much better than sum-rate maximization scheduling for data-centric M2M networks.",

        "1437": "In the last decade permanent magnet assisted synchronous reluctance machines (PMaSynRM) have gained more interest. Compared to induction machines in industrial applications, a good efficiency is achieved due to low rotor losses. The low power factor of a pure synchronous reluctance machine is mitigated by assisting ferrite magnets. These magnets are environmentally friendly, cost-saving and do not suffer under strong price fluctuations. As a drawback, they offer a low energy density compared to rare-earth magnets. The considered machine includes a special ribless rotor which provides a high anisotropy and low cross-coupling over the whole current operating area. Hence, the machine is well suited for sensorless operation. Furthermore, a high anisotropy has a positive impact on the torque. Differential inductances have a strong influence on the current waveform and on the sensorless control capability at low or zero speed. Therefore, the differential inductances are evaluated via three approaches: Finite Element Analysis, the flux linkages and test signal injection.",

Among the numerous advantages of multiphase induction machine drives, operation and self-starting under some phases open stand as the most important feature of such drives. With some phases open, optimal current control is proved viable to provide disturbance-free operation with some objective functions and under some operational constraints. Although hysteresis current control was simply employed in the literature with conventional field orientation to control the currents of healthy phases, it is not suitable for high power applications as it usually corresponds to high switching frequency and is susceptible to noise. Alternatively, synchronous reference frame (dq) control is much suitable; however, it requires back and forth transformations with several trigonometric calculations and additional sophistication to the controller with a corresponding intricate tuning process.

        "1474": "Rotor cage fault detection in inverter fed induction machines is still challenging nowadays as dynamics introduced by the control or the load influence the fault indicator signals usually applied. In addition, the detection is usually only possible when the machine is operated above a specific load level to generate a significant rotor current magnitude. This paper proposes a new method to detect rotor bar defects at zero load and around standstill. The method only uses the standard current sensors already available in modern industrial inverters and is thus non-invasive. It is thus well suited as start-up test for drives. By applying a transient voltage pulse sequence using the switching of the inverter and measuring the resulting current slope a new fault indicator is obtained. As a result, it is possible to clearly identify the fault-induced asymmetry in the machine transient reactances. Though the transient flux linkage cannot penetrate the rotor because of the cage, the faulty bar locally influences the zigzag flux leading to a significant change. Measurement results show the applicability and sensitivity of the proposed method",

Due to its tooth-concentrated winding and its particular magnet segmentation, this fault-tolerant machine is characterized by an electromotive force (emf) for which the fundamental and the third harmonic are of the same order. This specificity should improve the ability of the machine to operate without position sensor. Furthermore, as the virtual machines (denoted h1, h3 and h5 machines) that are used to control the 7-phase machine have quasi-sinewave back-emfs, several so-called emf-methods to sense the rotor position are available. For h1, h3 and h1h3 controls with a Phase-locked Loop (PLL) to estimate the position, the time simulations of the drive confirm the ability of the machine to operate without position sensor while ensuring low torque ripple and quite unchanged current waveforms. An experimental evidence of this property is given for sensorless h3-control (where the back-emf fundamental is used to sense the position).",

        "1477": "Permanent magnet assisted synchronous reluctance machines (PMA SynRM), stemming from the combination of synchronous reluctance and interior PM machine topologies, have recently gained increasing popularity as a viable candidate for electric vehicle traction applications due to concerns regarding the price volatility of rare-earth magnet materials. Their attractiveness can be attributed to their distinct torque production mechanism, which essentially relies on the reluctance torque component enabling the use of less expensive ferrites or bonded NdFeB magnet solutions. A drawback often associated with this machine topology is high torque ripple emanating from its intrinsically high salient nature [1]. Among several machine design techniques available to mitigate the high torque ripple, rotor step-skew is known to be one of the most effective and frequently incorporated solutions. When a step-skew is performed, it causes variation of magnetic flux density along the axial (skew) direction, and thus influences the machine's electromagnetic behavior [2]. Numerous methods are available in literature to account for the effects of skew using (either) 2D or 3D numerical finite element analysis (FEA), analytical, or semi-analytical approaches, the trade-off in each case being computational time versus accuracy. Due to the prohibitive computational time and numerical memory costs of 3D FEA, the prediction of a skewed machine's electromagnetic performance typically relies on 2D domain-based techniques, such as multi-slice 2D FEA [3] or more computationally efficient semi-analytical techniques [2] exhibiting comparable accuracy. A common limitation associated with these techniques is their inability to capture certain 3D phenomena, namely the end-effects and axial interaction between skewed steps, since they explicitly rely on the 2D domain [4]. The significance of such 3D effects is influenced by the axial length to airgap diameter ratio (viz. end-effect), the number of skewed steps, the skew angle and the structure of the machine topology under consideration. The quantification, and most importantly experimental verification, of the 3D effects associated with skewed PMA SynRMs has received limited attention in literature to date.",

Then, a computationally efficient model taking into account saturation and spatial effects using FE-obtained look-up tables is developed. Using the model, the control and the offline design of the controllers are carried out based on the two-axis reference frame model for both machines and the vector space decomposition for dual-star one. The comparison is made in terms of terminal current harmonics, torque ripple, power density, and closed-loop control dynamic performance. It is shown that the dual-star machine has higher power density and less torque ripple, but higher 5th and 7th current harmonics. Moreover, the effect of one imperfection which may come with the dual-star winding diagram, namely imperfect electrical phase shift between the respective currents or voltages of two stars, on the performance of the machine is studied.

        "1481": "A detailed magnetic, reluctance based, computational model of an induction machine into which a traditional, rotor-flux-orientated, vector, control-scheme has been grafted, is used to examine the influence of saturation of both main and leakage flux paths upon vector controlled drive performance. Individual machine teeth, windings and conductors are incorporated, as is pseudo 3 dimensional modelling of skew. The cross saturation effect is therefore determined from the basic dimensional, and winding, design data of the machine. Effective compensation methods can then be derived for practical implementation. Direct, rotor flux orientation and magnitude control is used to ensure that inaccuracies in a machine parameter based vector control scheme are not reflected in the results for cross saturation. Results for a 15 kW, 4 pole induction motor with rotor skewed 1 stator slot pitch show that skew leakage flux is predominantly responsible for cross saturation. The skew leakage flux is shown to heavily saturate one end of the machine and to reduce the air gap flux density at the other. At 200% rated load current this equates to a 20% reduction in direct axis flux if i\/sub d\/ is kept constant. To compensate for this reduction a 40% increase in i\/sub d\/ would be required.",

The topologies and operation principles of the WFFSM are illustrated firstly. Then, the effects of rotor skewing angle on static characteristics, e.g., open-circuit phase flux-linkage and back electro-motive-force due to field currents, electromagnetic torque, and torque ripple, have been investigated in depth by finite element analysis (FEA). Consequently, the optimal rotor skewing angle is determined. In addition, comparisons between the WFFSM and a prototype SRM having the same stator outer diameter and stack length are conducted, and the results indicate that for both PM-free machines, the skewed-rotor WFFSM exhibits better performance, including larger torque capacity and smaller torque ripple.

In the simulation the inverter is operated at different DC-bus voltage levels and different modulation indices, i.e. amplitude and frequency, for the PWM. The analysis is achieved using circuit simulation of the inverter linked with a 2D-finite element analysis (FEA) of the machine. The comparison focuses on the phase current and voltage, and distortion of the torque waveforms and the core, rotor and inverter losses. It is found that, at higher DC-bus voltage, higher phase current distortion is found and consequently higher torque ripple and induced harmonics in the rotor loss. Moreover, similar effect is found when higher amplitude modulation index is applied. Furthermore, higher frequency modulation index results in lower phase current harmonics and hence lower torque ripple and rotor loss however, this comes at the expense of the inverter loss.",

In this paper an autonomous commissioning method based on a neural network approach is proposed that does neither depend on a speed sensor present as a reference nor on a load dynamometer coupled to the machine and guaranteeing constant speed. The training data for the neural network is obtained using only acceleration and deceleration measurements of the uncoupled machine.

Such VF-PM machines have been shown to achieve low loss operation over a wide range of load and speed. For this type of machine, the PM flux linkage varies during the magnetization manipulation process. Published magnetization techniques have occurred at zero load conditions and thus did not generate torque pulsations. However, under loaded conditions, the existing methods would produce unwanted torque pulsation. This paper proposes a parameter insensitive method to solve this issue. This method generates a decoupling current command that is calculated from accurately estimated stator flux linkage. Accurate flux estimation, i.e., insensitive to inductance saturation and PM flux linkage variation (e.g., temperature or magnetization level) is achieved by using the voltage disturbance estimated by a closed-loop stator current vector observer. In both simulations and experiments, it is shown that even during magnetization processes under loaded conditions, the flux can be estimated correctly, and smooth torque output can be achieved.",

An algorithm using airgap power and voltage is used to select a lookup table which reduces error in developed torque. Sensitivity is then used to determine the effectiveness of the proposed controller. From this, the proposed controller leads to reduced torque error and reduced sensitivity of the torque to flux error.

The AFPMSM is usually analyzed based on the three-dimensional finite element method (3D FEM) due to its three-dimensional magnetic field distribution. However, the 3D FEM suffers large amount of calculation, time-consuming and is not suitable for the optimization of AFPMSM. Addressing this issue, a multi-layer quasi three-dimensional equivalent model of the AFPMSM is investigated in this paper, which could take the end leakage into consideration. Firstly, the multi-layer quasi three-dimensional equivalent model of the AFPMSM with single stator and single rotor is derived in details, including the equivalent processes and conversions of structure dimensions, motion conditions and electromagnetic parameters. Then, to consider the influence of end leakage on the performance, a correction factor is introduced in the multi-layer quasi three-dimensional equivalent model. Finally, the proposed multi-layer quasi three-dimensional equivalent model is verified by the 3D FEM based on an AFPMSM under different structure parameters. It demonstrates that the errors of flux linkage and average torque obtained by the multi-layer quasi three-dimensional equivalent model and 3D FEM are only around 2% although the structure parameters of the AFPMSM are varied. Besides, the computation time of one case based on the multi-layer quasi three-dimensional equivalent model is only 6 min, which is much less than that of the 3D FEM, 1.8 h, under the same conditions. Thus, the proposed multi-layer quasi three-dimensional equivalent model could be used to optimize the AFPMSM and much time could be saved by this method compared with the 3D FEM.",

However, faults may appear and inflict great losses. So, condition monitoring of such machines is critical to avoid unscheduled stops and unplanned maintenance. This paper works towards that direction. The authors are proposing a new off-line method to reliably detect the static eccentricity fault in synchronous salient pole electrical machines. The method is based on the monitoring of all three phase currents of the machine during locked rotor at three different rotor positions. A pseudo zero-sequence current is then calculated, the frequency spectrum of which can reveal reliable indicators to detect this fault. The proposed method has been tested experimentally with success, while the results indicate that it is possible to estimate the fault level severity.",

Machine learning techniques are widely used in medical fields for diagnosis. These algorithms use feature values from images as input to make a decision. The process consists of three stages-The feature extraction stage, the training stage and the testing stage.

The inductances of both the SM and the DRM are calculated with a phasor-diagram based 2-D finite-element method (FEM), which can include the effects of eddy current and saturation. The calculated results show that the effect of eddy current can be neglected for both the SM and DRM inductances, and the cross-magnetization influence on the SM inductances can be ignored but is remarkable on the DRM inductances. The magnetic coupling between the SM and the DRM is calculated with 2-D FEM, and it is found that little magnetic coupling exists, so the SM and the DRM can be controlled independently, which is a very good feature for HEV applications. With the effect of skewed slots considered, the torque and no-load line-to-line back electromotive force (BEMF) curves of the SM and the DRM are calculated with multislice 2-D time-stepping FEM.

Different sensorless techniques have been proposed to estimate the rotor position using current and voltage measurements of the machine. Detection of the back-electromotive force (EMF) zero-crossing moments is one of the methods most used to achieve sensorless control by predicting the commutation moments. Most of the techniques based on this phenomenon have the inherit disadvantage of an indirect detection of commutation moments. This is the result of the commutation moment occurring 30 electrical degrees after the zero-crossing of the induced back-emf in the unexcited phase. Often, the time difference between the zero crossing of the back-emf and the optimal current commutation is assumed constant. This assumption can be valid for steady-state operation, however a varying time difference should be taken into account during transient operation of the BLDC machine. This uncertainty degrades the performance of the drive during transients and higher speed. In this paper a new method is proposed to overcome this problem which improves the performance while keeping the simplicity of the back-emf zero-crossing detection method.

        "1618": "This paper presents a quasi-three-dimensional (3-D) nonlinear magnetic equivalent circuit (MEC) model for double-sided axial flux permanent magnet machines (AFPMMs) with fractional slot concentrated windings. The proposed model can take into account not only the local magnetic saturation effect but also the 3-D flux distribution. A coupled variable permeance element is proposed in airgap modeling that captures both axial and circumferential airgap flux densities. With the help of the coupled variable permeance element, the transient magnetic field is considered by the time varying connection of the airgap and the rotor. The proposed model can be used to predict the performance of AFPMMs, including the 3-D distribution of no-load and armature airgap flux densities, no-load back electromotive force, and electromagnetic torque. In order to verify the reliability of the MEC model, two AFPMM prototypes are taken as examples, and the accuracy is verified by comparing the calculated parameters of the MEC model with the finite element analysis and experimental results. Finally, the effect of local saturation on the performances of AFPMMs is investigated.",

This special mode occurs when a PM machine is spinning at a high speed and gating signals are simultaneously removed from all of the inverter switches. This investigation shows that the UCG operating characteristics are quite different when the PM machine is combined with a CSI that uses normally on switches, compared to the use of a conventional voltage-source inverter (VSI). The presence of the stiff dc-link current prevents high transient currents from being developed in the machine phases that can expose the machine's rotor magnets to significant demagnetization risks. As a result, the UCG characteristics of the CSI-based PM machine drive with normally on switches are more benign than those of comparable VSI-based drives, representing an advantage of the CSI drive configuration during fault-mode operation. Experimental test results for UCG-mode operation with a 2.6-kW current-source PM drive are included that exhibit good agreement with the analytical predictions.",

It was found that in electric machines when inductor ripple is sinusoidal and phase winding is supplied with polyharmonic currents, DC component of electromagnetic torque is produced by harmonic components number 0.2 and 1. When inductor ripple in winding is sinusoidal, higher current harmonics in armature winding do not produce a DC component of electromagnetic torque when the rotor is spinning but cause it to ripple.

However, similar harmonic leakage coefficient curves for FSCW PM machines having close slot and pole combinations receive few attention. Since high-order magneto motive force (MMF) component rather than fundamental MMF component is utilized in FSCW machine, harmonic leakage inductance could be several times larger than main inductance.

It has a stack of surface-mounted permanent magnet (SPM) rotor and a stack of synchronous reluctance (SynR) rotor, which are axially combined on the shaft. Unlike the traditional PM-assisted SynR machine (PMASynRM), the magnets are not located in the flux barriers of the SynR rotor, and therefore, the magnets and flux barriers have no more geometric confliction between them. The two rotor stacks can be circumferentially shifted to any relative angle. Clearly, the shifting angle and the axial length ratio between the two rotor stacks, together with the phase angle of the armature current vector, influence the motor performance, and their optimal design is detailed in this article. Analysis of the prototypes shows that the studied PMSynRM evidently exhibits higher torque density than the conventional PMASynRM.",

From a technical perspective, the detection of left and right initial foot contacts (ICs) is essential for the computation of stride-by-stride outcome measures including gait asymmetry. However, in a majority of studies only one sensor close to the center of mass is used, complicating the assignment of detected ICs to the respective foot. Therefore, we developed an algorithm including supervised machine learning (ML) models for the robust classification of left and right ICs using multiple features from the gyroscope located at the lower back. The approach was tested on a data set including 40 participants (ten healthy controls, ten hemiparetic, ten Parkinson\u2019s disease, and ten Huntington\u2019s disease patients) and reached an accuracy of 96.3% for the overall data set and up to 100.0% for the Parkinson\u2019s sub data set.

Meanwhile, due to the advantages of cellular networks (e.g., excellent coverage and mobility\/roaming support), cellular-enabled M2M communication is a promising solution for M2M-based applications. However, there are significant challenges in cellular-enabled M2M communications due to the special features of M2M-based applications [e.g., massive concurrent uplink transmissions, small bursty traffic, and the high requirements of energy efficiency (EE)]. On the other hand, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) can simultaneously serve multiple users at the same frequency and time by splitting different users in the power domain and thus increase the number of concurrent connections. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient resource allocation scheme with hybrid time division multiple access (TDMA)-non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for cellular-enabled M2M networks. First, we configure the user equipments (UEs) as the machine type communication gateways (MTCGs). Then, we propose our time sharing scheme. Next, we formulate the resource allocation problems as a noncooperative game. Finally, in order to obtain the optimal EE of machine type communication devices (MTCDs) and UEs in the game to confirm the power allocation, we transform each non-convex optimization problem into the convex form by using nonlinear fractional programming and solve the transformed problem by Dinkelbach's method and Lagrangian duality theory.

This motor has two sets of three phase windings that implemented spatially with 30 electrical degrees. Vector Space Decomposition (VSD) frame and Multiple Stator (MS) frame are well known for its vector control. VSD frame has been applied in many applications due to its clear harmonics mapping and good extensions to multiphase machines. On the other hand, MS frame is more intuitive as to treat two winding sets individually so that the accumulated techniques of three-phase machines can be applied directly. However, this approach was not adopted in high performance drives because its decoupling control methodology is not sufficiently developed to solve its inherent magnetic coupling issue. Therefore, this paper proposed a decoupling control scheme to improve dynamic performance of MS frame, and performance has been evaluated by experimental results.",

Herein, over-constrained VMs are defined as those who are not given sufficient system resources to meet their workload specific objective functions. To validate our approach, a variety of workload-specific benchmarks inspired by common Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud workloads were used. Workloads were run while regularly sampling VM resource consumption features exposed by the hypervisor. Datasets were curated into nominal or over-constrained and used to train ML classifiers to determine VM over-constraint rules based on one-time workload analysis. Rules learned on one host are transferred with the VM to other host environments to determine portability. Key contributions of this work include: demonstrating which VM resource consumption metrics (features) prove most relevant to learned decision trees in this context, and a technique required to generalize this approach across hosts while limiting required up front training expenditure to a single VM and host. Other contributions include a rigorous explanation of the differences in learned rulesets as a function of feature sampling rates, and an analysis of the differences in learned rulesets as a function of workload variation. Feature correlation matrices and their corresponding generated rule sets demonstrate individual features comprising rule sets tend to show low cross-correlation (below 0.4) while no individual feature shows high direct correlation with classification.

Therefore, we propose a probabilistic learning-based intention classifier and conduct a performance validation. The training data was reshaped by processing the sensor data acquired from the actual driving and extracting the characteristic points of the maneuver. The verification data was collected on a road not included in the training data. We conducted a comparative experiment with the RAdio Detecting And Ranging (RADAR) signal for the front target and a deterministic classifier called a Support Vector Machine (SVM). Statistically, the proposed RVM-based method succeeded in predicting the lane change of the surrounding vehicle faster than both the RADAR sensor and the SVM.

Recently, maximum margin discriminant analysis (MMDA) was proposed that extends the large-margin idea to feature extraction. It often outperforms traditional methods such as kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) and kernel Fisher discriminant analysis (KFD). However, as in the SVM, its time complexity is cubic in the number of training points $m$, and is thus computationally inefficient on massive data sets. In this paper, we propose an  $(1+\\epsilon)^2$-approximation algorithm for obtaining the MMDA features by extending the core vector machine. The resultant time complexity is only linear in $m$ , while its space complexity is independent of  $m$. Extensive comparisons with the original MMDA, KPCA, and KFD on a number of large data sets show that the proposed feature extractor can improve classification accuracy, and is also faster than these kernel-based methods by over an order of magnitude.

It has been shown that by controlling the current through the DC field windings, magnet flux can also be controlled. Under a short-circuit fault in one of the windings, it is seen that by turning the magnet off, the fault current is reduced to 50% of its original value. Also, the phase windings of the proposed machine have high self inductance and low mutual inductances thereby, achieving good phase isolation for fault-tolerance.",

In concrete, due to the machine saliency (difference between Ld and Lq) and the application of pulse voltage test vectors is possible to estimate the permanent magnet position for further low and zero speed sensorless control. The novelty of this paper is the fact that a matrix converter is used instead of the conventional voltage source inverter. The direct AC\/AC or matrix converter is a novel topology of great interest in specific wind energy applications since it avoids the use of electrolytic DC coupling capacitors, which is a potential source of failures. The paper presents the position signals for matrix converters and shows all the control algorithm. Finally, some simulation results with proper angle estimation, when speed reversal, corroborates the proper functionality of the control scheme.",
        "1706": "In this paper, we present a new approach to direct torque control (DTC) with minimization torque pulsations in permanent magnet synchronous machines (PMSM). The synchronous machine torque control, based on the DTC structure, permits to obtained high dynamic performances. In classical DTC, due to the hysteresis based scheme, the switching frequency is variable, current distortion and torque ripple are more important. Moreover high sampling frequency is needed for digital implementation. In order to obtain a constant switching frequency and hence torque ripple minimization, we introduces a new control technique for PMSM. It consists of controlling directly the electromagnetic torque by using a modulated hysteresis controller. The improvements obtained are principally a constant switching frequency in the inverter and an important reduction of the torque ripple. A digital-signal-processor (DSP) based controller is used to study the application of direct torque control method for PMSM. The implementation in a test bench shows the effectiveness of this control. Results obtained by simulation and experimental tests of this strategy are presented.",

        "1711": "The traditional methods used for presenting and visualizing the non-dominating solutions in multi-objective electric machine optimization problems mainly include the parallel coordinate plots, the histogram plots and the scatter plots displaying the Pareto fronts approximations. However, their visualization performances degrade with the increase of non-dominating design candidates or the increase in the number of objectives to be optimized. In particular, since the aforementioned methods cannot perform clustering or classification on the input data set, it is very difficult to locate or identify the values of all the objectives for a specific candidate, even after identifying one or two objectives of such candidate favorably meets certain design requirements, which is common in a series of 2-D plots with Pareto fronts. Moreover, the objectives of different design candidates become nearly indistinguishable in a parallel coordinate plot. As an attempt to tackle this problem in the machine design domain, this paper presents a case study that utilizes the self-organizing map (SOM) to visualize the design objectives of a high-speed switched reluctance machine. The results demonstrate that the SOM provides useful information with its intrinsic functionalities including data clustering, component-plane displays and data projections that are not offered by some conventional visualization techniques. Therefore, the SOM visualization can allow better integration of the knowledge and expertise of machine designers into specific electric machine design and optimization problems, and also assist them in the final decision-making process to choose the most appropriate designs.",

The main control strategies used for such a drive system are the Master-slave (MS) control and the Mean control. The performance of these control methods can get affected by the inherent asymmetries in the induction machines. A commonly occurring example of asymmetry is a stator winding turns short circuit fault. In a two-machine system, since both machines are connected to a common inverter, a fault in one machine affects the performance of the other machine through the drive control system. A detailed comparison of the machine interactions which take place in two-machine drive systems controlled by the MS and Mean control methods is done considering a situation where there is a stator inter-turn fault in one of the machines.

        "1722": "Machine learning (ML) algorithms are nowadays widely adopted in different contexts to perform autonomous decisions and predictions. Due to the high volume of data shared in the recent years, ML algorithms are more accurate and reliable since training and testing phases are more precise. An important concept to analyze when defining ML algorithms concerns adversarial machine learning attacks. These attacks aim to create manipulated datasets to mislead ML algorithm decisions. In this work, we propose new approaches able to detect and mitigate malicious adversarial machine learning attacks against a ML system. In particular, we investigate the Carlini-Wagner (CW), the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) and the Jacobian based saliency map (JSMA) attacks. The aim of this work is to exploit detection algorithms as countermeasures to these attacks. Initially, we performed some tests by using canonical ML algorithms with a hyperparameters optimization to improve metrics. Then, we adopt original reliable AI algorithms, either based on eXplainable AI (Logic Learning Machine) or Support Vector Data Description (SVDD). The obtained results show how the classical algorithms may fail to identify an adversarial attack, while the reliable AI methodologies are more prone to correctly detect a possible adversarial machine learning attack.

        "1724": "Most condition monitoring techniques for rolling element bearings are designed to detect the four characteristic fault frequencies. This has lead to the common practice of categorizing bearing faults according to fault location (i.e., inner race, outer race, ball, or cage fault). While the ability to detect the four characteristic fault frequencies is necessary, this approach neglects another important class of faults that arise in many industrial settings. This research introduces the notion of categorizing bearing faults as either single-point defects or generalized roughness. These classes separate bearing faults according to the types of fault signatures that are produced rather than by the physical location of the fault. Specifically, single-point defects produce the four predictable characteristic fault frequencies while faults categorized as generalized roughness produce unpredictable broadband changes in the machine vibration and stator current. Experimental results are provided from bearings failed in situ via a shaft current. These results illustrate the unpredictable and broadband nature of the effects produced by generalized roughness bearing faults. This issue is significant because a successful bearing condition monitoring scheme must be able to reliably detect both classes of faults.",

In this paper, we have developed a new method of parameter estimation based on real time data sampling of voltages and currents, no matter whether they are sinusoidal or not. The assumption of a synchronous rotating speed of the stator flux is not critical.

Permanent magnet brushless AC machines employed in applications such as electric vehicles and spindle drives are operated under both constant torque and constant power modes.

Most investigations consider only the no-load iron loss. However, the iron loss requires careful consideration, particularly under high-speed, flux weakening control. The paper investigates the airgap flux density distribution, the flux density loci in the stator core, and the associated iron loss in two brushless AC motor topologies, having a surface-mounted magnet rotor and an interior-mounted magnet rotor, respectively, when operated under maximum torque per ampere control in the constant torque mode and maximum power control in the flux-weakening mode.",

The position error production mechanism is firstly derived, i.e., the error changes with the trend of current variation when there is a parameter mismatch. Based on this mechanism, by injecting sinusoidal current signals into both sets of three-phase windings, the presence of parameter mismatch and its level can be revealed through the corresponding sinusoidal responses from the estimated speed of sensorless observers. Since the amplitudes of rotor position error responses decrease as the parameter mismatch level reduces, with the help of the least mean square (LMS) algorithm, the parameters can be adaptively adjusted to the actual values, and the position error can be thus corrected. Moreover, through a simple technique and with the extra freedom of DTP machines, the detrimental effects because of current signal injection can be eliminated. The proposed method has been validated through simulation and experimental results.",

Recently, a generalization of this model and an algorithm for it were introduced, showing significant advantages over the conventional MIL model on certain application areas. Unfortunately, that algorithm is not scalable to high dimensions. We adapt that algorithm to one using a support vector machine with our new kernel k\\wedge. This reduces the time complexity from exponential in the dimension to polynomial. Computing our new kernel is equivalent to counting the number of boxes in a discrete, bounded space that contain at least one point from each of two multisets. We show that this problem is #P-complete, but then give a fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS) for it. We then extend k\\wedge by enriching its representation into a new kernel kmin, and also consider a normalized version of k\\wedge that we call k\\wedge\/\\vee (which may or may not not be a kernel, but whose approximation yielded positive semidefinite Gram matrices in practice). We then empirically evaluate all three measures on data from content-based image retrieval, biological sequence analysis, and the musk data sets.

This paper presents estimation error based performance comparison of five different supervised learning algorithms: Support Vector Regression, Polynomial Regression, Linear Regression and two different models of Neural Networks for prediction of aerodynamic drag coefficient corresponding to each vehicle in a two, three and four vehicle platoon configurations based on the drag coefficients provided by experimental study at different inter-vehicle distances. Predicted drag coefficients are then juxtaposed with CFD data from numerical simulations to evaluate closeness to experimental drag coefficients. Results reveal that polynomial regression model best fits the aerodynamics with 0.0223 estimation error. To the best of our knowledge no machine learning based methods have been applied before for modeling aerodynamic drag on vehicle platoon.",

With a VR headset, viewers can individually choose the perspective they see on the head-mounted display by turning their head, which creates the illusion of being in a virtual room. In this experimental study, we applied machine learning methods to anticipate future head rotations (a) from preceding head and eye motions, and (b) from the statistics of other spherical video viewers. Approach. Ten study participants watched each 3 1\/3 hours of spherical video clips, while head and eye gaze motions were tracked, using a VR headset with a built-in eye tracker. Machine learning models were trained on the recorded head and gaze trajectories to predict (a) changes of head orientation and (b) the viewport from population statistics. Results. We assembled a dataset of head and gaze trajectories of spherical video viewers with great stimulus variability. We extracted statistical features from these time series and showed that a Support Vector Machine can classify the range of future head movements with a time horizon of up to one second with good accuracy. Even population statistics among only ten subjects show prediction success above chance level. %Both approaches resulted in a considerable amount of prediction success using head movements, but using gaze movement did not contribute to prediction performance in a meaningful way. Even basic machine learning models can successfully predict head movement and aspects thereof, while being naive to visual content. Significance. Viewport forecasting opens up various avenues to optimize VR rendering and transmission. While the viewer can see only a section of the surrounding 360\u00b0 sphere, the entire panorama has typically to be rendered and\/or broadcast. The reason is rooted in the transmission delay, which has to be taken into account in order to avoid simulator sickness due to motion-to-photon latencies. Knowing in advance, where the viewer is going to look at may help to make cloud rendering and video streaming of VR content more efficient and, ultimately, the VR experience more appealing.",

The proposed high-speed machine is both a motor for electromagnetic (EM) energy conversion and an axial flow compressor for thermodynamic energy conversion. Conventional designs usually have a separate motor and compressor that are connected through a common shaft with or without a gearbox. The proposed design simplifies the high-speed machine and compressor system by eliminating the components that connect the motor and the compressor. The integrated motor-compressor design can achieve a more compact system. The flux-switching permanent magnet (FSPM) machine is chosen out of several possible electric machine topologies with salient rotor pole features for the integrated motor design.

This maximum impedance point was found experimentally to be as low as 33 kHz, which is well within the switching frequency ranges of modern inverter drives. This paper investigates the possibility of exploiting the maximum impedance point of the machine, by taking it into consideration when designing an inverter, in order to minimize ripple currents due to the switching frequency. Minimization of the ripple currents would reduce torque pulsation and losses, increasing overall performance. A modified machine model was developed to take into account the resonant point, and this model was then simulated with an inverter to demonstrate the possible advantages of matching the inverter switching frequency to the resonant point.

Hence, there is a need for a consistent and detailed description of the dependency of the interface parameters on machine properties. This paper proposes a method to obtain detailed design trends of electrical machines with a very high level of detail, based on large-scale application of multiobjective optimization using finite element models. The method is demonstrated by quantifying the power density of surface-mounted permanent magnet (SPM) machines versus rotor surface speed, power level, and cooling approach. It is found that power density strongly depends on cooling approach, followed by rotor surface speed, but barely on power level.

Two high-frequency per phase motor impedance models are developed, and circuit parameters are extracted from the measured CM and differential-mode motor impedance data. The influence of the high switching speed of SiC MOSFET on CM voltage is identified. The CM motor current is estimated under different switching speeds and different high-frequency motor impedance models using simulation.",
        "1837": "With the application of fast switching power electronics and high dynamic control to ac machines the occurrences of fault condition have increased in the past years. The degradation of the bearings is the most frequent fault condition on modern inverter fed drive applications. In this contribution a new reliable method is proposed to detect fault conditions that result in air gap asymmetry. It is based on the step response of the machine phase currents to an excitation with voltage pulses applied by the switching of the inverter. Simulation results of a magnetic equivalent circuit model of an induction machine are presented to show the influence of air gap asymmetry on the transient electrical current slopes of the machine. Based on these results the necessary transient excitation and the evaluation algorithm are derived to detect and isolate these asymmetries. The only inputs necessary for the realization of the method are the phase currents which are also necessary for the current control loop during normal operation of the drive. Thus no additional sensors are needed to implement the proposed method. Finally, measurement results are given for a special machine equipped with eccentric sleeves in the bearing housings. The applicability of the method is verified for stationary as well as transient operation.",

The first model represents the system as a three-phase induction machine, the second model represents it as a five-phase induction machine. The dynamic behavior of the system is deduced from the per-phase models, therefore, the dynamic of the system is described either by an equivalent three-phase machine dynamic model or by that of an equivalent five-phase machine. Two indirect oriented flux control schemes corresponding to the dynamic models are proposed.

Such a machine tool should be characterized by low mass, adequate machining accuracy and high machining stability. The paper presents the design of an ultra-light, axisymmetric, portable machine tool for in situ flange face milling. Due to a high compliance of the designed machine tool and a need of maintaining its low mass, structural modification aimed at stability increase were highly limited. Therefore, it was decided to select the spindle ensuring machining stability. The selection of the spindle was supported by finite element analysis. Based on numerical analyzes results a prototype with a proper spindle was build. Then, the accuracy of the finite element model and the predicted stability were experimentally verified, showing a good agreement with the real counterpart. Finally, two general conclusions were formulated: (i) in the case of machine tools characterized by high compliance and limited possibility of modifying their design a good choice may be the selection of a spindle that allows to obtain parameters that ensure stable machining, and (ii) it is possible to build low-dimensional, reliable finite element model without using substructuring or reduction methods, and a well-thought-out discretization and replacement elements of complex load bearing systems instead.",

A mathematical model based on magnetic harmonic functions is used to account for saturation. Distortions on the air gap flux due to non-linear magnetic characteristics lead to appearance of space harmonics in the resultant flux density distribution. This causes specific distortions in stator and rotor time quantities, which are different from those due to static converter. Operation with six pulse and sinusoidal PWM converters under saturated conditions is considered.

This novel semisupervised method can easily produce interpretable semantic descriptions to outline different categories by forming a fuzzy set with semantic explanations realized on the basis of the AFS theory. Besides, it is known that disagreement-based semisupervised learning (SSL) can be viewed as an excellent schema so that a co-training approach with SVM and the AFS theory can be utilized to improve the resulting learning performance. Furthermore, an evaluation index is used to prune descriptions to deliver promising performance. Compared with other semisupervised approaches, the proposed approach can build a structure to reflect data-distributed information with unlabeled data and labeled data, so that the hidden information embedded in both labeled and unlabeled data can be sufficiently utilized and can potentially be applied to achieve good descriptions of each category.

Physical machines that host many VMs have limited capacity and if they are overloaded their performance might degrade or completely fail. A VM machine that hosts several different applications on a heavily loaded PM can be migrated to another under loaded PM in order to exploit the availability of the resources and to balance the load. In data centres, VMs exposed to huge amount of user traffic, if VM migration occurs on a network link that is overwhelmed with user traffic, then it will create a bottleneck if there's not enough bandwidth on the link to support the VM migration. Therefore, there is a clear need for mechanisms to control user traffic on both source and destination PMs in order to provide guaranteed bandwidth that needed for VM migration.",

These factors influence the performance of electrical machines and need to be considered in advanced machine design processes or numerical modeling. Most of the aforementioned effects occur locally in the machine and, therefore, need to be described locally.

        "1880": "The sensorless control of induction machines, particularly for operation at low speed, has received significant attention in recent years. To realize a field-oriented control of AC machines that is able to work at zero speed, the most commonly used methods are either sensor-based models or transient-signal-excitation methods. The major disadvantage of present signal-injection methods is that they are intrusive to pulsewidth modulation (PWM). An additional switching sequence has to be embedded in the control that will cause a torque and current ripple. In order to overcome these problems, a new flux-estimation algorithm that uses the phase current derivative to extract the flux-position information is presented. In contrast to previously introduced methods, this new approach operates without additional transient excitation of the machine and requires only fundamental-wave excitation using standard PWM or slightly modified PWM. Furthermore, only the current response in the two active states of PWM is used. This makes it possible to use sensorless control for the whole speed range including overmodulation and removes the distortion and parasitic influence of the zero switching states during the estimation of the flux. Experimental results are presented to validate the applicability of the presented approach.",

Non-permanent-magnet (non-PM) electric machines are a potential solution and are increasingly investigated by researchers worldwide. This paper presents a DC-biased reluctance machine, which is structurally similar to a conventional switched reluctance machine. This type of machine has a DC field winding and an AC three-phase armature winding. It uses a conventional three phase inverter for the armature and an additional auxiliary DC\/DC converter for the field winding.

        "1883": "Testing the high-power machines in general is not an easy task. One of the standard tests is the full-load test. This test typically requires another machine, of the same or higher power rating, to be coupled to the tested one. For multiphase machines, which are commonly designed for high-power applications, this test can be conducted in a different way. In order to simplify full-load test, this paper proposes a new method that is applicable for multiple three-phase machines with even number of neutral points. The method is based on indirect rotor-field oriented control. It enables evaluation of the efficiency and the thermal design in the case of synchronous machines and the segregation of the constant and stator variable losses for induction machines, without the need for coupling another machine as a load. In the presented method, the full-load test conditions on the stator are obtained by circulating the rated active power flow in a closed loop from one winding set to another. The only power used during the test is to cover machine and converter losses. The proposed control scheme is unique and is based around y-component from the vector space decomposition subspace. It is validated through the simulation and experimental results.",

These machine types are designed and optimized to meet the application-oriented design requirements and constraints. An extensive Pugh matrix is created where each machine type is scored based on efficiency range, cost, volumetric power density, gravimetric power density, acoustic noise and stress on the rotor, fault tolerance, heat rejection, and manufacturability. Each Pugh matrix component is assigned to a priority-based weighting, based on the application demand, to determine an accumulated score for each machine topology.

The previously proposed machine was large for small truck. The air gap length was small, 0.6 mm. The coil end of the armature winding was large because it used the traditional fraction slot winding. Therefore, this paper discusses downsizing it with wider air gap and employing the concentrated winding. As a result, the new designed machine has attained the targeted torque, 600 Nm.",

The resulting IPM machine operation as a generator in combination with an uncontrolled rectifier must be properly understood and accounted for in the machine design to avoid damage to either the machine or inverter. An approximate closed-form solution is derived in this paper which relates the resulting machine phase current (and torque) to the IPM machine parameters, the DC-link voltage and the rotor speed. The resulting operating characteristics are particularly interesting for IPM machines that have been designed with inductance saliency ratios greater than 2 (i.e., high-saliency machines). The validity of the approximate solution is confirmed using dynamic simulation results, and the implications of these results for the machine designer seeking to minimize or eliminate the impact of this undesired operating mode are thoroughly discussed.",
        "1890": "Support vector machines (SVMs) are currently state-of-the-art for the classification task and, generally speaking, exhibit good predictive performance due to their ability to model nonlinearities. However, their strength is also their main weakness, as the generated nonlinear models are typically regarded as incomprehensible black-box models. In this paper, we propose a new Active Learning-Based Approach (ALBA) to extract comprehensible rules from opaque SVM models. Through rule extraction, some insight is provided into the logics of the SVM model. ALBA extracts rules from the trained SVM model by explicitly making use of key concepts of the SVM: the support vectors, and the observation that these are typically close to the decision boundary. Active learning implies the focus on apparent problem areas, which for rule induction techniques are the regions close to the SVM decision boundary where most of the noise is found. By generating extra data close to these support vectors that are provided with a class label by the trained SVM model, rule induction techniques are better able to discover suitable discrimination rules. This performance increase, both in terms of predictive accuracy as comprehensibility, is confirmed in our experiments where we apply ALBA on several publicly available data sets.",

Three conventional permanent magnet machines are compared to a flux switching and modulated pole machine. Each of the topologies is optimised to give a specific force whilst adhering to a limit on the mass of the moving component. Using simple vector analysis, it is shown that machine power factor and efficiency are improved by optimising the machines with an objective function of minimising the MMF. Transient solver results are used to validate the static solver results and provide estimates on efficiency and operating power factor. This method of optimisation is shown to give modulated pole machines with relatively high power factors, which is a known limitation of this class of machine. The modulated pole machine topology could be the best option among all five topologies as it has high efficiency and high power factor.

Motivated by that, an efficient energy harvesting-based medium access control (MAC) protocol is designed in this paper. In this protocol, different devices first harvest energy adaptively and then contend the transmission opportunities with energy level related priorities. Then, a new model is proposed to obtain the optimal throughput of the network, together with the corresponding hybrid differential evolution algorithm, where the involved variables are energy-harvesting time, contending time, and contending probability. Analytical and simulation results show that the network based on the proposed MAC protocol has greater throughput than that of the traditional methods.

After the brief review of the machine structure, the general slot and pole number combinations are listed: Firstly, the conventional modular machines used to construct the proposed modular machines need to possess integer times of 3 repetitive machine units. Each machine unit should construct as a 3-phase type. Then, a redundant machine unit providing the redundant teeth for modularity is necessary. This redundant machine only has one pole pair to make sure the space waste is minimal. The slot number of this redundant machine is determined by the greatest common divisor of the slot and pole pair numbers of the conventional modular machine. Finally, the combination of the conventional modular machine and the redundant one generates the proposed modular machine.

Based on finite element analysis (FEA), the performance of proposed fault-tolerant control strategy has been simulated. The predicted results show the fault-tolerant control strategy can effectively keep average thrust force and thrust ripple virtually unchanged after fault occurance. In addition, the influence of module gap on fault-tolerant performance has also been investigated. The larger module gap tends to improve fault-tolerant performance due to lower mutual inductances between phases, but decrease average force simultaneously. The proposed fault-tolerant control strategy can also be extended to other three-phase machines.",
        "1905": "At present, permanent magnet synchronous machines(PMSMs) are widely used. Although PMSMs have the advantages of high torque density, high power density and high efficiency, the use of permanent magnets increases the cost and processing difficulty of PMSMs. Synchronous reluctance machines(SynRMs) are a competitive alternative to PMSMs with their low cost and high reliability. However, due to the lack of permanent magnets,the torque density of SynRMs is less than that of PMSMs under the same conditions. This is a major disadvantage of SynRMs and needs to be further explored. Many factors affect the torque of the SynRMs, and the number of pole pairs is the first consideration when designing machines. This paper proposes a equation for calculating the inductance of d-axis , q-axis and torque based on the simplified magnetic circuit model and analyzes the influence of the number of pole pairs on the inductance and torque theoretically. It is found that with the increase of the number of pole pairs, the inductance of d-axis, the inductance of q-axis and the torque of SynRMs decrease. Finally, the relationship between the number of pole pairs and torque is verified by Finite Element Method (FEM), and also explains why the number of pole pairs of most SynRMs is 2.",

The low-pole topology of high-speed machine is favorable to minimize fundamental frequency requirement. The lowest possible three-phase topology of the FSPM machine, with six stator slots and four rotor poles (6\/4), has unacceptably large second-order harmonic distortion in the flux linkage and severe cogging torque in its conventional single-stator-single-rotor form. To resolve these challenges, a novel dual-stator structure is proposed that eliminates the even-order harmonics in the flux linkage. Harmonic distortion and cogging torque are notably reduced in the proposed machine. The principles of operation and design methods are described in this paper. The properties of the proposed dual-stator 6\/4 FSPM machine are compared with a conventional 6\/4 FSPM machine and a conventional 12\/10 FSPM machine for a 5 kW, 15 000 r\/min design.

An on-line method is used to adjust the parameters of a Takagi-Sugeno identifier model to match the behavior of IFO induction machine drive system. Then, using the certainty equivalence principle, the parameters of the Takagi-Sugeno identifier model are employed in a standard control design method for the standard parallel distributed compensator to provide a global asymptotically stable equilibrium for the closed loop IFO drive system. In this way, identifier does not need to have any initial knowledge about the IFO drive system and as the identifier becomes more accurate, the controller parameters of the parallel distributed compensator will be adjusted, and if the identifier succeeds in its task, the controller will too. The proposed controller is simulated for a 5 hp induction machine drive system. The comparison of the standard PI and APDC is presented by simulation as well. These results prove that the proposed controller is robust to load changes and system disturbances and can also follow different command trajectories very well without any re-tuning of the controller.",

However, very few works have been done on Bangla text for social media activity monitoring due to a lack of a large number of annotated corpora, named dictionaries and morphological analyzer, which demands in-depth analysis on Bangladesh's perspective. Moreover, solving the issue by applying available techniques is very content specific, which means that false detection can occur if contents changed from formal English to verbal abuse or sarcasm. Also, performance may vary due to linguistic differences between English and non-English contents and the socio-emotional behaviour of the study population. To combat such issues, this paper proposes the use of machine learning algorithms and the inclusion of user information for cyber bullying detection on Bangla text. For this purpose, a set of Bangla text has been collected from available social media platforms and labelled as either bullied or not bullied for training different machine learning based classification models. Cross-validation results of the models indicate that a support vector machine based algorithm achieves superior performance on Bangla text with a detection accuracy of 97%.

The benefit of utilising the series resonance principle to induction machines comes from applying high currents with low voltages at high speeds. However, high voltage requirement at low frequencies is the main disadvantage of this machine. Therefore, the acceleration and deceleration of the machine are limited due to the high voltage requirement at these frequencies. A combination of the conventional induction machine and resonant induction machine topologies is presented in this paper to improve the practicality of the resonant induction machine. An asymmetrical six-phase induction machine is utilised to enhance the acceleration and deceleration of the machine. The six-phase machine consists of two isolated three-phase winding sets where the first winding set is connected to three capacitors in series with the winding set's phases. The other winding set is connected to the inverter terminals directly. Indirect rotor-field oriented control is utilised to control the proposed machine, where vector space decomposition is used to achieve the machine's speed control.

The investigations are based on a small power machine (DSa = 100 mm, l = 80 mm) which is designed for the needs of a special application where a defined clearance between the stator and rotor is required to ensure the working principle. The increased air-gap volume promotes the machine cooling from the stator inner surface by means of applying ordinary rotor (step) skewing technique for the salient pole reluctance rotor. In order to proof this cooling concept a test-setup is build up for thermal evaluation purposes. A more widely applicable approach for the thermal heat dissipation within the machine stator is also presented. In this case, the heat is directly extracted from the coil sides of the stator phase winding employing heat pipes.

The proposed approach has two significant characteristics: 1) DCOT-LS-SVMs is inspired by a stacked hierarchical architecture that combines several layer-by-layer LS-SVMs modules. The module that forms the higher layer has additional input features that consider the predictions from all previous modules and 2) cross-output knowledge transfer is used to leverage knowledge from the predictions of the previous module to improve the learning process in the current module. With this approach, the model\u2019s parameters, such as a tradeoff parameter  $C$  and a kernel width  $\\delta $ , can be randomly assigned to each module in order to greatly simplify the learning process. Moreover, DCOT-LS-SVMs is able to autonomously and quickly decide the extent of the cross-output knowledge transfer between adjacent modules through a fast leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. In addition, we present an imbalanced version of DCOT-LS-SVMs, called IDCOT-LS-SVMs, given that imbalanced datasets are common in real-world scenarios.

        "1961": "It is widely believed that the use of a virtual machine monitor (VMM) is at least as secure, if not more secure than separate systems. In reality, the security of a single system running in a virtual machine can never be as secure as that single system running in its own dedicated physical hardware. If for no other reason, the security of that system in a virtual machine depends on the correct operation of both the operating system and the hypervisor software, while in a dedicated physical computer, it depends only on the correct operation of the operating system. The VMM case always has more opportunity for exploitable security flaws. While many people view virtual machine monitors as something special and different, in realty they are just special-purpose operating systems. The major difference is that the API to a virtual machine monitor is the instruction set of the virtual machine, while the API to an operating system is a set of system calls to manipulate processes, file systems, perform I\/O, etc. To the extent that a particular VMM uses paravirtualization, it begins to look more like a classical operating system than a VMM.",

The manufacturers have to optimize the product to be competitive, while the user wants to be sure that the motor is in accordance with the insulation temperature class limit. The most accepted condition to measure temperature rise in induction motors is under full load since it simulates the real operating conditions.

In these alternative methods the load torque applied by the dynamometer is smaller than the motor nominal torque or even no load torque applied. This paper will present a comparison between the most common induction machines temperature rise methods.",
        "1968": "This paper presents a design approach for interior permanent-magnet (IPM) machines with variable-flux characteristics using low-coercive-force magnets for improved efficiency and extended operating speed range. A flux-intensifying IPM type with is used in the design due to positive Id operation and reduced loaded Iq effects. Design considerations of machine structures and variable-flux machine attributes are discussed. In addition, leakage flux in a rotor is particularly designed to also obtain another flux-varying capability. Evaluation of the designed machine is provided by finite-element analysis simulations and experiments on a proof-of-principle machine. The designed machine shows benefits in increasing efficiency and speed range in a low-torque region when variable magnetization control of the low-coercive-force magnets or the design of the leakage flux proposed in this paper is implemented.",
        "1969": "The objective of this letter is to propose a drive-based control method for damping joint vibrations in order to improve the machining quality and the productivity of robot machining. The machining quality is significantly determined by the transfer behavior of the gearboxes installed in the robot joints. This letter presents a novel approach for drive-based damping of these vibrations and thus for increasing the dynamic path accuracy on the basis of secondary encoders. The approach represents an enhancement of the independent joint control, which is widely used in industry. The simulation as well as the experimental results on a KUKA KR210-2 demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented control method for damping gearbox vibrations and increasing the dynamic path accuracy of industrial robot manipulators.",
        "1970": "Synchronous Reluctance Machines (SyncRM), began to draw a lot of attention in last decade and presently receives a great deal of interest, since the cost of active materials is much lower than for a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine. For automotive applications a high torque and power density, low torque ripple and a wide speed range is required. The synchronous reluctance machine is still under development and intensive investigation is being carried out. This paper presents the influence of stator and rotor pole number combinations with a stator configuration which for cost reduction purposes uses only concentrate windings.",
        "1971": "Speed sensorless control of AC machines at zero speed so far is only possible using signal injection methods. Especially when applied to induction machines spatial saturation leads to a heavy dependence of the control signals on the flux\/load level. This dependence has to be identified on a special test stand during a commissioning procedure. To avoid the usage of a speed sensor as well as load dynamometer coupled during the commissioning an adaptive flux model is proposed that delivers an accurate reference flux angle. After the commissioning this adaptive flux model is used in combination with the signal injection method to deliver the spatial flux position.",
        "1972": "Accurate loss calculation is an important part of the machine design, which can have significant influence on the predicted operating temperature, especially in the high-speed applications. In this paper, the calculation method of additional copper losses is demonstrated with an example of high-speed induction machine. The additional copper losses are studied using finite element analysis for twisted and non-twisted stator windings. In the proposed study, only one coil is modeled with strands to optimize computational resources. Influence of an accurate determination of the end winding leakage inductance on additional loss is presented. Proposed method of the analysis can be implemented for loss estimation of various high-speed electrical machines.",
        "1973": "There has been recently a growing interest in the use of transductive inference for learning. We expand here the scope of transductive inference to active learning in a stream-based setting. Towards that end this paper proposes Query-by-Transduction (QBT) as a novel active learning algorithm. QBT queries the label of an example based on the p-values obtained using transduction. We show that QBT is closely related to Query-by-Committee (QBC) using relations between transduction, Bayesian statistical testing, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and Shannon information. The feasibility and utility of QBT is shown on both binary and multi-class classification tasks using SVM as the choice classifier. Our experimental results show that QBT compares favorably, in terms of mean generalization, against random sampling, committee-based active learning, margin-based active learning, and QBC in the stream-based setting.",
        "1974": "Storm surge elevates the water level, resulting in floods that cause significant harm to our lives and property. Predicting possible occurrences of storm surge using machine learning technology has long piqued the interest of the different communities. However, it is observed that the accuracy rate of predictions is insufficient. This paper aims to develop a framework for evaluating the performance of various machine learning models. Various algorithms are being used to forecast storm surge incidents in Hong Kong and Kaohsiung. The inclusion of trend changes in atmosphere pressure and wind components throughout the implementation of the algorithms to the dataset gathered over the past is one of the innovative aspects of this work. These inclination characteristics are very vital and crucial to capture important correlations and features for the potential occurrence of storm surges. This study yields two major findings. First, even the basic method of an ensemble algorithm produces better results than any single algorithm. Second, determining the best performing ensemble models for those storm surge events is achievable based on the technique findings for the data analyzed.",
        "1975": "A multiphase machine is more reliable than a three-phase one, but it usually shows reduced performance under faulty behaviour. In this paper, the performance in case of open-phase fault is analyzed, and two fault tolerant control algorithms, which aim to minimize the Joule losses in the remaining healthy phases, are compared. The proposed control techniques are validated by numerical simulations, and to prove their effectiveness some experimental results are presented. The experimental tests have been carried out on a quadruple three-phase induction machine, fed by four independent inverters, developed for More Electric Aircraft (MEA) applications.",
        "1976": "In this paper, an advanced control technique using fuzzy logic tuned by a genetic algorithm is proposed in order to obtain a high accuracy positioning of a six-phase induction machine. The proposed control scheme is fully insensitive to mechanical configuration changes as well to loss of one up to three phases. The effectiveness of the method has been validated experimentally using a dedicated set-up based on a 90W-2 pole squirrel-cage induction machine and a 42V dc bus.",
        "1977": "An inductance determination method that can be based on both experiments and calculations is discussed in this paper. The inductances of a four-quadrant transducer (4QT) prototype machine were measured and calculated with the two-dimensional time-stepping finite-element method (FEM), and the measured and calculated results are in good agreement. It is found that the d- and q-axis inductances are different, and the inductances obtained from the phase and line voltage are also different for both the two machines of the 4QT prototype machine. Analysis shows that the differences are caused by the saliency and d-axis saturation. Although there is little saliency for the double rotor machine (DRM), the two kinds of the inductance differences of the DRM are more serious than that of the stator machine (SM). This is because of the higher level of the d-axis saturation of the DRM. The inductances obtained from the phase voltage at very low frequency are recommended as final results for both experiments and calculations.",
        "1978": "Continuous improvements in insulating materials, manufacturing consistencies in sealed windings and extensive laboratory testing of various systems show that synchronous machines with NEMA II construction can replace totally enclosed machines. Tests on windings in corrosive atmospheres show that sealed insulation systems are impervious to the environment. Standard maintenance ensures that incendive arcing will not be generated in potentially hazardous environments. When compared to totally enclosed machines, the NEMA II-type construction is lighter, more efficient, has lower short-circuit current and associated torques and is easier to maintain.",

The Pap-Smear examination is now becoming as one of the most important screening methodologies in the speedy identification of this form of carcinoma, and among all strategies, the diagnostic test is the one that is most widely used in cervical cancer diagnosis. Machine Learning has the ability to provide accurate prognosis by using machine algorithm to perform classification, prediction, and estimation to achieve a high prediction rate. The Ensemble approach incorporates three machine learning techniques: K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest. With the precision percentage of 97.83 percent, the last technique provides more accurate results. To summarize, machine learning has the potential to achieve high diagnosis accuracy, while still being effective.",

        "1981": "A persistent and serious danger to the Internet is a denial of service attack on a large scale (DDoS) attack using machine learning. Because they originate at the low layers, new Infections that use genuine hypertext transfer protocol requests to overload target resources are more untraceable than application layer-based cyberattacks. Using network flow traces to construct an access matrix, this research presents a method for detecting distributed denial of service attack machine learning assaults. Independent component analysis decreases the number of attributes utilized in detection because it is multidimensional. Independent component analysis can be used to translate features into high dimensions and then locate feature subsets. Furthermore, during the training and testing phase of the updated source support vector machine for classification, their performance it is possible to keep track of the detection rate and false alarms. Modified source support vector machine is popular for pattern classification because it produces good results when compared to other approaches, and it outperforms other methods in testing even when given less information about the dataset. To increase classification rate, modified source support Vector machine is used, which is optimized using BAT and the modified Cuckoo Search method. When compared to standard classifiers, the acquired findings indicate better performance.",
        "1982": "The aim of this paper is to develop a doubly-fed induction machine (DFIM) model suitable for the simulation of this machine in the healthy mode and faulty mode. Indeed, the developed model allows the simulation of the inter-turn short circuit in the stator or the rotor of the machine in any system with control circuits and\/or connections to the grid by means of power electronics converters. The circuit-oriented approach has been chosen in order to represent the DFIM model as a rotating transformer. Of course, since this model doesn't need any transformation, it is possible to simulate any kind of asymmetry in both stator and rotor sides with or without variations of the machine parameters. In addition, the first turn of one phase of the stator and the rotor was modeled using the circuit-oriented approach to simulate an inter-turn short circuit in both stator and rotor. A specific wound-rotor induction machine model, using only resistances, inductances and controlled voltage sources, has been developed. The coupling effects between stator and rotor have been taken into account stator-rotor mutual inductances. The performances of the model have been verified by comparison between simulation and experimental results on a 5.5 kW-50 Hz-8 poles DFIM working in generating mode at different load conditions.",
        "1983": "In this paper, a new structured-light machine vision technique based on a radial basis function (RBF) neural network is proposed and an inspection system is established. General structured-light machine vision techniques are usually based on accurate mathematical models and have some unavoidable and inexpressible errors. The proposed new technique is based on the training and learning of high-accuracy samples and overcomes the disadvantages of the general technique and considerably improves the accuracy of machine vision inspection systems. An experiment applying this new technique to inspect the position-control accuracy of a step-motor controlled stage with one linear translation axis shows that the RBF artificial neural network (ANN) is quite suited to structured-light machine vision inspection systems and that structured-light machine vision inspection techniques are really a novel and effective means for the inspection of the position-control accuracy of motor control systems.",
        "1984": "This paper will present two new Flux Switching Modulated Pole Machine (FS-MPM) topologies which have a similar structure to a Modulated Pole Machine. It aims to address the complexity of the rotor, by introducing a FS-MPM design in which the magnets are removed from the rotor and placed on the stator. Furthermore the number of magnets in the FS-MPMs is greatly reduced when compared to a standard MPM; reduction in component count and simplification of the rotor will offer a significant benefit in terms of cost and ease of production.",
        "1985": "An electric machine controller has a very important and integral role within a hybrid electric vehicle drivetrain. This paper investigates the functions within this powertrain that are traditionally decomposed as machine control functions, and how the machine controller interacts with other functions. Next, different physical partitioning solutions are illustrated within a sample hybrid powertrain configuration. However, many of these partitions will require different levels of expertise for suppliers of the system components. Then, the paper discusses some logical next step partitions that may apply to production powertrains. The paper concludes that the electric machine controller will not be \"absorbed\" by another controller in the vehicle until the hybrid powertrain becomes a widely utilized subsystem.",
        "1986": "This paper studies the preventive maintenance schedule of CNC machine tool, which is of failure rate of Weilbull distribution. The machine failure cause by tool wear is modeled by Poisson process of Weilbull distribution, and the optimal period preventive maintenance schedule on the principle of maximum average service rate is represented by mathematical model. The existence of optimal preventive maintenance schedule is analyzed. By the means of Monte Carlo stochastic numerical simulation, a sample of optimal preventive maintenance strategy of CNC machine tool is obtained based on the real data of machine failure. The result of the paper shows that the machine preventive maintenance could improve the average service rate, which is valuable to the industry practice.",
        "1987": "Based on the abc fundamental reference axis system, the dynamic process of an AC machine with PWM control is discussed in detail. The induction machine is a nonlinear high-order system. This system becomes more complicated when a nonsinusoidal PWM power source is introduced to the motor. Therefore, the machine behaves in a continuous periodic transient process. States according to switch pattern for the machine performance supplied by PWM including dead-band interval preventing shoot-through fault are studied in detail; a mathematical model is established. The performance of machine powered by PWM is explored based on abc frame. The simulation result using MATLAB is also presented.",
        "1988": "The low efficiency is the main problem for canned switched reluctance machines (SRM) at high speed. A simple and effective way to reduce the loss is to control the phase current waveform. Based on an ordinary SRM without cans in this paper, the controller is redesigned, which is characterized by having variable step voltage supply according to rotor position. Meanwhile, loss in power electronics is reduced by optimizing the windings. The canned machine is able to operate with much higher efficiency by the proposed methods.",
        "1989": "Network fault knowledge acquisition is a necessary part of intelligent network management. In the paper, knowledge acquisition of two hierarchies is designed for modern network of large scale and some performance parameters instead of management information base are used to model the network faults so that the evaluations of network fault knowledge acquisition can easily be uniformed. Our knowledge acquisition methods are based on support vector machine. Basic support vector machine learning is applied to local network fault knowledge acquisition, and incremental PSVM is improved to be adapted to global dynamic network fault knowledge acquisition. Simulations indicate the correctness and efficiency of our method and the global network fault knowledge acquisition based on proximal support vector machine is still to be improved further.",
        "1990": "Directly driven in-wheel machines are required to generate high output power at low speed. The authors previously proposed the use of a permanent magnet vernier machine, which is suitable for applications that require large torque. The remarkable feature of the previously proposed machine is the use of only ferrite magnets in a `V' configuration. This machine satisfied the required output characteristics of the in-wheel machine for EV and demonstrated high efficiency in computer simulations based on FEA. However, the design of this machine was somewhat problematic. Therefore, the present paper discusses downsizing of the machine, providing a wider air gap, and the use of concentrated windings. We have achieved an effective design for downsizing while maintaining the output and the torque density. The volume of the newly designed machine is 53% smaller than that of the previous machine, and target performances of 40 kW and 400 Nm were obtained.",

        "1992": "This paper presents non-conforming sliding interfaces for motion in 3-D finite element simulations. Sliding interfaces are favorable, especially for field circuit coupling in comparison to other approaches such as the Lockstep method because an arbitrary position of the rotor is possible. A previously presented approach by the authors is extended to take eddy-currents into account. The sliding interfaces approach utilizes specific Lagrange multiplier to handle the relative motion between stator and rotor which require a magnetic scalar potential formulation. The formulation is presented as well as methods to compute the mandatory cohomology basis functions.",
        "1993": "The anisotropy of the lamination material, which is usually negligible in the fundamental wave behavior of inverter fed machines, influences the transient control signals and may act as a disturbance during operation. The anisotropy is determined by torque measurements of lamination sheets as well as by the evaluation of the transient electrical behavior of inverter fed induction machines and can produce errors up to 40%.",
        "1994": "This work is about analyzing surface mounted permanent magnet machines regarding their sensitiveness related to erroneous magnet positioning. A finite element analysis based approach is presented and different topologies in terms of slot and pole count are compared. The study further includes the analysis of multiple magnet widths and stator teeth widths. By contrast to most of previous studies, the work is based on evaluating the cumulative distribution function of the cogging torque in case of non-idealities. A Monte Carlo importance sampling based strategy is focused. This approach facilitates studying arbitrary tolerance distributions. Results reveal that topologies with particularly promising rated cogging torque behaviour exhibit the most significant performance degradation in presence of tolerances. A linear relationship is identified for cogging torque performance as function of the accuracy in magnet positioning. Results emphasize the necessity of tolerance analyses for electric machine design to not overrate their performance in the presence of manufacturing uncertainties.",
        "1995": "A 5-axis hybrid computer numerical controlled machine was developed using a 2 degree of freedom spherical parallel mechanism known as the Agile Eye. The hybrid machine design consisted of a 3-axis serial gantry type structure, with the Agile Eye being placed at the end of the Z-Axis to allow for machining on inclined planes. A control system was designed that controlled two kinematic systems, the 3-axis serial kinematic system and the 2-axis parallel kinematic system. This paper details the design of the agile eye, its kinematic models and the integration of the agile eye mechanism to create a functional hybrid machine.",
        "1996": "Multiphase machines are considered suitable options in high-performance industry applications for their advantages such as enhanced toque density and fault-tolerance capability. However, in the case of extremely arduous condition, the fault-tolerance capability of multiphase machines is quite limited. This paper proposes a multiphase dual-winding flux modulated permanent magnet machine with two independent sets of armature windings placed on stator and rotor slots, which realizes better torque enhancement and significant fault-tolerance capability. The topologies of the machine and the drive are introduced first, followed by the mathematic model in stationary coordinate system and synchronous rotating coordinate system. Then, the toque performance of the proposed machine is analyzed by FEA. Finally, the excellent transient characteristics and fault-tolerant performance of the proposed machine is proved in the Matlab\/Simulink simulation.",
        "1997": "This study discusses the quality analysis of a new tapping machine. By measuring the torque and speed of the tapping machine, the correlation between the quality of the nut and the tapping process is analyzed. Using various regression trees and learning methods, the results show that the magnitude of the tapping torque is an essential indicator of the quality of the thread. In addition, through such methods, the appropriate operation boundary of the tapper torque and tapper speed can be determined. Thread, processed in the two boundaries, can have a high probability of being a Class 1 thread. Furthermore, the tapping torque is also used for quality classification by a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1-D CNN). The 1-D CNN model performs high classification accuracy and has the ability to localize the important area of the signal. The experimental results show that the regression tree can effectively find the operation boundary, providing information for users to adjust their machine settings, and improve the thread quality. In addition, the off-line classification of thread done by humans can be replaced by the high-accuracy 1-D CNN model predicting the thread quality in real-time. The detection speed can be accelerated, and labor costs can be reduced.",
        "1998": "A method is proposed for predicting the flux-weakening performance of permanent-magnet (PM) brushless ac machines accounting for skew and d-q axis cross-coupling. The method is based on a d-q-axis flux-linkage model, a hybrid 2-D finite-element (FE)-analytical method being used to predict the d- and q-axis inductances. However, it only requires 2-D FE analysis of the magnetic field distribution over a cross section of the machine. The developed method is used to predict the torque-speed characteristic of an interior PM brushless ac machine with one stator slot-pitch skew. This is compared with predictions from a direct FE analysis of the machine and validated by measurements.",
        "1999": "A 3D scheme-field model of electromagnetic AC and DC energy conversion has been developed for the dynamic short-circuit modes of the combined armature windings of the synchronous machine. It allows taking into account the influence of design features, the effects of self-and mutual induction of the windings, the nonlinearity of the electrophysical and magnetic properties of active and structural materials on electromagnetic processes and the combined armature winding parameters of the synchronous machine. An approach is proposed for determining the DC leakage and mutual inductances of a combined armature winding of the synchronous machine armature. It is based on the decomposition of electromagnetic processes with help combinations of switching phases of the armature windings relative to the external field source by union of the phase windings electrical circuits and the geometric 3D area of the active armature of the synchronous machine. It was proved, that the magnetic coupling between the AC and DC inductive parameters of the armature windings does not exist. The reliability and accuracy of the results of numerical modeling are confirmed by the results of physical tests on a prototype."
