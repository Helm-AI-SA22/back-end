    "abstract": "The research of hyperspectral image classification is one of the main contents of hyperspectral remote sensing application. In recent years, machine learning technology has made great progress in the field of image processing. In this paper, three common machine learning algorithms (KNN, SVM, 3D-CNN) are summarized, and experiments are carried out in Pavia University hyperspectral remote sensing data set, and the average accuracy is 85.34%, 92.53%, 96.86%, respectively. The results show that 3D-CNN algorithm has the highest accuracy in hyperspectral image classification, followed by SVM and KNN.",
