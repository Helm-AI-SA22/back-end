{"documents":[{"abstract":"The demand for cost-effective and ecologically sustainable components of machine tools is increasing continuously. Synchronous reluctance machines (SynRM) have become more and more attractive for variable speed drive applications in recent years due to the absence of permanent magnets. Advanced control approaches such as Linear Quadratic Integral (LQI) controllers or model predictive controllers (MPC) are well explored for permanent magnet synchronous machines (PMSM). This paper simulatively investigates these controllers for a SynRMdriven feed drive axis in machine tools. To evaluate this new drive concept, a simple model for SynRM considering the non-linear motor parameters is introduced. Advanced control approaches, i.e. a combination of Dead-Beat predictive controller and (LQI) controller is proposed for the position control task for SynRM in feed drives. The dynamic behavior of the feed drive system is modelled as a mass-spring-damper, which is taken into account when designing the optimal controllers. The aim is to achieve an optimal position/speed control with high bandwidth and low sensitivity to disturbances, such as torque ripples and sudden load changes. The control performance is compared with classic Proportional Integral (PI) controllers in both time domain and frequency domain through simulation.","autors":"T. Xi; S. Kehne; M. Fey; C.

Electrically driven conventional compressor systems need electric machines as prime movers to provide mechanical energy to rotate the compressor. The proposed novel integrated permanent magnet machine system synthesizes both an electric machine and an axial-flow compressor into a single device to convert electrical power to mechanical rotational power of the rotor, which simultaneously compresses the gas. This novel integrated design simplifies the compressor system by eliminating the connection between the electric machine and compressor. Weight, volume, and cost savings are expected. The feasibility of the proposed concept is demonstrated by combining the principle knowledge in electric machine design and compressor design. The operating principles of this novel integrated machine are described in the paper. Analytical design methods are used to study the proposed integrated machine and compressor.

Predicting its lifetime is an extremely challenging task, as it involves elements of chemistry, material science and electrical engineering. This lifetime prediction/assessment, if performed under standard \u201cin-service\u201d operating conditions, can require months (and in some cases years) of testing. Therefore, accelerated lifetime tests, performed on suitable specimens, are conventionally run for fulfilling such task, as they reduce the total testing time. During these tests, the stress level applied to the examined system (i.e. insulation) is enhanced with respect to normal operating conditions, with the aim of reaching the end of life in a relatively short amount of time. It is thus of crucial importance selecting an appropriate specimen's typology, as the choice might strongly influence the tests' outcome. In this work, the accelerated thermal aging results for three different specimens' typologies, i.e. twisted pair, motorette and coil, are presented and apprised. The tests are carried out on a round enamelled magnet wire, to be employed for the winding of low voltage electrical machines. Among the three specimens, it is found that twisted pairs tend to largely over-estimate the thermal lifetime, with respect to both motorettes and coils.","autors":"V. Madonna; P. Giangrande; M.

However, in the flux weakening region, it is usually difficult to determine the excitation current, while the extra copper loss due to field excitation may cause significant reduction in the machine performance especially efficiency. Therefore, a new control strategy for the HESFPMMs, which can operate in both flux-enhancing and flux-weakening regions, has been proposed. It utilises a novel feature of HESFPMMs in which the flux produced by the permanent magnets can be inherently shortcircuited via the iron flux-bridges. Hence, in this proposed method, the field excitation current is set to zero in order to avoid the copper loss of the field winding in the flux weakening region. Meanwhile, it utilizes the voltage difference between the command and real voltages, and does not require the machine parameters to modify the excitation current reference in flux-enhancing mode and the d-axis current reference in flux-weakening mode. In addition, in order to improve the tracking accuracy of the excitation current, the current feedback control is employed. As a result, the proposed method can provide a smooth speed transition from flux-enhancing mode to flux-weakening mode.

The RN model developed is used to model three types of electrical machines (linear machine, radial field rotating machine and axial field rotating machine). Our goal is to establish lightweight models for the pre-design of electrical machines. The performances (local and global quantities) of these machines are evaluated using this 3D RN modeling. The results obtained from this approach are validated by comparison with results issued from the 3D FE analyses.","autors":"A. A. Diriye; Y. Amara; G.

For low power machines, this is typically a non-issue since test beds are relatively inexpensive and accessible. However, as power levels increase into the upper kilowatt and megawatt range, validation of prototype machines and drives becomes costly. These costs are primarily: materials, transportation, and test site development and operation. The virtual machine (VM) concept provides a solution for de-risking these costs by utilizing the power-hardware-in-the-loop (PHIL) concept in conjunction with high-fidelity machine models and detailed load dynamics. The VM and load dynamics are simulated with a real-time digital simulator which generates appropriate control commands to a power electronics based voltage amplifier that interfaces via a cascaded LC-LC type filter to a variable speed drive (VSD). The controlled voltage amplifier, in conjunction with the LC-LC type filter, acts as a current sink to the VSD. Provided the voltage amplifier has sufficient bandwidth, the VM will closely represent the terminal characteristics of a real machine and load, with respect to the VSD. This paper addresses the establishment of a 25 kW virtual machine test bed and associated issues.","autors":"F. Fleming; C. S. Edrington; M. Steurer; O.

In order to achieve uniform flux density distributions, an asymmetrical stator geometry is proposed. A new set of geometrical parameters has been defined to balance the flux densities in the stator, while maintaining the same slot geometry (i.e., current density and amount of copper) and iron volume. The comparison, between a classical geometry and the proposed asymmetrical one, is carried out with the results showing the differences on the stator flux densities and the resulting torque performance. The new concept of asymmetrical design is validated for a surface mounted permanent magnet (SPM) machine as a case study. The outcomes of this work highlight the potential benefits of the presented solution with respect to the core saturation.","autors":"D. De Gaetano; G. Sala; M. Degano; D. Gerada; C.

The three-phase induction machines represent the majority of the machines used in the industry. Due to that, there is a motivation for researches to investigate how to improve induction machines efficiency or how to replace them with other types of machines having higher efficiency level. The benefits of the induction machine are line-start capability, robustness, and price. Line-start capability means that there is no need for extra power electronics. Avoiding of the power electronics in the case when only one certain load point is needed can lead to a price decrease, smaller environmental footprint, and more compact solution. An alternative machine type that can provide potentially higher efficiency compared to the induction machine, especially for small powers is a line-start permanent magnet machine.The topic of this paper is dedicated to the design and analysis of a 1.5 kW four-pole line-start permanent magnet machine for general usage. The designed line-start permanent machine is using the same stator lamination as the standard commercial 1.5 kW totally enclosed fan-cooled induction machine. The results of the design, together with electromagnetic analysis of the line-start permanent magnet machine performance, are illustrated. It is demonstrated that a simple replacement of the induction machine rotor by the line start permanent magnet rotor using the presented approach can facilitate in achieving of the higher efficiency level of the machine.","autors":"J.

The error compensation method so far plays the most popular and effective way to minimize the thermal error. How to accurately and quickly build an applicable thermal error model (TEM) is the kernel work of thermal error compensation. On the basis of some comprehensive machine-learning schemes, past proposed TEMs had impressive merits for dealing with the thermal error modeling of single-function (milling or turning cutting) machine tools with only considering one set of thermal key points. These proposed modelling methodologies become worse when applied to CNC compound milling-turning machining centers in actual cutting applications. This paper proposes a two-mode integral TEM based on the Lasso and the random forest regression schemes to quickly and accurately predict the thermal deformations of such a machine. The first mode is the thermal error modeling for milling cutting conditions, and the second mode is that for turning cutting conditions. For data reduction, two different sets of temperature key points, one for milling and the other for turning, are obtained. Then, on the basis of the random forest regression scheme, we separately establish two TEMs but concurrently use them to predict the tool-center-point deformations of both milling as well as turning spindles. Further, we compare our proposed TEM with several frequently-used machine-learning-based TEMs and the results show that our proposed TEM are the best among all, no matter in the modelling experiment or in the test experiment. The proposed TEM has a maximum prediction error of 6.08  $\\mu \\text {m}$ for milling cutting and that of 1.455  $\\mu \\text {m}$  for turning cutting in the modeling experiment. By our proposed two-mode integral TEM, the thermal error of a multi-function milling-turning machining center can be accurately predicted and quickly compensated.","autors":"W. Lian; L. Zhang; K. -C.

First, the structure and operational principle of the proposed machine are described. Next, the static characteristics are computed using 2D finite element analysis.
